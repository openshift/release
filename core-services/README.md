# Core Services and Configuration

Manifests for important services (like [OpenShift CI cluster](https://api.ci.openshift.org/)
and the CI service components that run on it) are present in this directory. The
services configured here are critical for some part of the OpenShift project
development workflow, must meet basic quality criteria and must be deployed to
the cluster automatically by a postsubmit job.

## How to add new service

Create a new directory for your service, containing all [necessary files](#quality-criteria-and-conventions).
You may copy the `_TEMPLATE` directory and start using the files there. Add
manifests and other configuration as needed.

## Quality criteria and conventions

1. All directories should contain `OWNERS` and `README.md` files. This is
enforced by `make check` locally and by the `ci/prow/core-valid` check on
pull requests.
2. Config is applied to the cluster using the [`applyconfig`](../tools/applyconfig)
tool. The tool applies all YAML files under your service subdirectory. All
   YAML filenames should follow the following convention:
    - All admin resources should be in `admin_*.yaml` files
    - Names of YAML files that should not be applied to the cluster should start
      with `_`.
    - The remaining YAML files are considered "standard" resources.
3. `applyconfig` applies files in lexicographical order. In the case when some
resources need to be created before others, this needs to be reflected by the
naming of the files (e.g. by including a numerical component).
4. The `config-updater` service account in the `ci` namespace must have
permissions to apply all standard resources.
5. Destination namespaces should always be specified within a manifest, never
rely on a currently set OpenShift project.
6. All ConfigMaps need to be set up for automated updates by the
`config-updater` Prow plugin.

## How to apply

There are three types of configuration: admin resources, other resources and
ConfigMaps.

### Automation

1. Admin resources are not automatically applied to the cluster.
2. Other resources are automatically applied to the cluster by a Prow
   [postsubmit](https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/?job=branch-ci-openshift-release-master-core-apply)
   after each PR is merged, and also [periodically](https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/?job=openshift-release-master-core-apply).
3. ConfigMaps are automatically updated by the `config-updater` Prow plugin,
   configured in its [config.yaml](../cluster/ci/config/prow/config.yaml) file.
   Additionally, they are [periodically](https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/?job=openshift-release-master-config-bootstrapper)
   synced by a Prow job.

### Manual

1. Admin resources can be created by users with `--as=system:admin` rights by
   `make core-admin`.
2. Other resources can be created by `make core`, provided the user has rights
   to perform all necessary actions
3. ConfigMaps can be manually created by the [config-bootstrapper](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/cmd/config-bootstrapper)
   tool.

Additionally, the [`applyconfig`](../tools/applyconfig) can be used directly.
See its [README.md](../tools/applyconfig/README.md) for more details.
