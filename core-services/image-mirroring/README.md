Mirroring images to external repositories
=========================================

Image mirroring is documented [docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/mirroring-to-quay/](https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/mirroring-to-quay/)

Mirroring images from external repositories
===========================================

The `_config.yaml` file is used to mirror public images from various registries into [QCI](https://quay.io/repository/openshiftci)and `registry.ci.openshift.org`,
making these images available to `ci-operator`.

This process is documented in [docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/external-images/#mirror-public-images](https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/how-tos/external-images/#mirror-public-images)
