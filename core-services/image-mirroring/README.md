# Mirroring images to external repositories

Images built and promoted by Prow/ci-operator jobs are only kept inside the CI
cluster registry. To publish them, they need to be mirrored to an external
repository, like Quay. This is achieved by periodic Prow jobs. These jobs
consume image mappings from the subdirectories of this directory. These image
mapping files determine what should be mirrored where and are usually separated
by version. In a nutshell, the steps are

* send the push credentials to DPTP
* promote image to internal registry
* define mappings of mirroring
* define the mirroring job

## Promote the built image in CI

As a prerequisite, specify `promotion` snippet in [ci-operator's config](https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md#promotion)
to promote the image built in the CI process. _Note that the promoting image must NOT overwrite other images_.
If the image is promoted to a new namespace, e.g., `openshift-new-production`,

* In [roles.yaml](../../cluster/ci/config/prow/openshift/ci-operator/roles.yaml), add role `image-tagger` and rolebinding `image-tagger-ci-operator` for `openshift-new-production`.
* The admin of the namespace should allow the SA in the mirroring job defined below to access the images with `oc image mirror`, e.g., [admin_openshift-kni_list.yaml](admin_openshift-kni_list.yaml) which makes the images open to the public.


Check if the image is built successfully:

> oc get is -n openshift-new-production is_name -o yaml -o yaml | yq '.spec.tags[].name'

We will use the tag(s) in the mapping file(s) defined below.

## Configuring mirroring for new images

Simply submit a PR adding the image to the appropriate mapping file. You will
need an approval of an owner of the image set. The following external repositories
are currently targeted by existing mirroring jobs:

 - [codeready-toolchain](./codeready-toolchain/): `quay.io/codeready-toolchain`
 - [knative](./knative/): `quay.io/openshift-knative`
 - [kubefed](./kubefed/): `quay.io/openshift/kubefed-*`
 - [openshift](./openshift/): `quay.io/openshift`
 - [tekton](./tekton/): `quay.io/openshift-pipeline`
 - [toolchain](./toolchain/): `quay.io/openshiftio`
 - [ocs-operator](./ocs-operator): `quay.io/ocs-dev`
 - [integreatly](./integr8ly): `quay.io/integreatly`
 - [openshift-kni](./openshift-kni): `quay.io/openshift-kni`
 - [openshift-psap](./openshift-psap/): `quay.io/openshift-psap`

## Configuring mirroring for new sets of images

Submit a PR adding a new subdirectory here, with at least a single mapping file
and an `OWNERS` file (so that you can maintain your mappings). The mapping files
should follow the `mapping_$name$anything` naming convention to avoid conflicts
when put to a ConfigMap. Submit a PR which contains the new mappings, and after merging,
we can expect to see them when

> oc get cm -n ci image-mirror-mappings -o yaml | yq -r '.data | keys[]'

Additionally, you will need to add a new Periodic job
[here](../../ci-operator/jobs/infra-image-mirroring.yaml).  You should not need
to modify anything in the job besides the items marked as `FIXME`, where you
just need to fill in the name of your image set (it should be the same as the
name of the subdirectory here). To push images to an external repository, the
job needs credentials.
Use `docker`/`podman` to generate `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` and send it with gpg-encryption it to DPTP. These credentials need to be available in the cluster as
a secret. The secrets are stored in DPTP Bitwarden vault and then synced to the
cluster: [talk to DPTP on Slack](https://coreos.slack.com/messages/CBN38N3MW)
about storing the credentials in Bitwarden.
