# Release Gating Jobs.

This directory contains the configuration for release gating and informing jobs.  [Our documentation](https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/release-gating/) contains details on the future direction for nightly payload gating.  Please discuss with the [Technical Release Team approvers](/OWNERS_ALIASES) before working on any new blocking jobs.  Jobs marked as "optional: true" will be prioritized.
