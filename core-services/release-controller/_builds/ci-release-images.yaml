# ART builds many container first images with golang builder images. We want upstream CI
# builds to use a builder image as close to the ART builder as possible. To that end, 
# ART will mirror its builder images to api.ci. However, we cannot use these images directly
# for CI. On top of the ART builders, we need to create yum repositories configuration 
# files that will allow CI builds access to the same repositories available during an ART
# build (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GqmPMzeZ0CmVZhdKF_Q_TdRqx_63TIRboO4uvqejPAY/edit#heading=h.kv09dibi95bt).
# 
# This builder image, now appropriate for CI, needs a few more tools to satsify some 
# CI testing & packaging tests. A "release" image is therefore built on top of the
# builder image with these packages installed.
# 
# This build creates a RHEL-7 golang release image for CI for OpenShift 4.1.

# ART builds many container first images with golang builder images. We want upstream CI
# builds to use a builder image as close to the ART builder as possible. To that end, 
# ART will mirror its builder images to api.ci. However, we cannot use these images directly
# for CI. On top of the ART builders, we need to create yum repositories configuration 
# files that will allow CI builds access to the same repositories available during an ART
# build (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GqmPMzeZ0CmVZhdKF_Q_TdRqx_63TIRboO4uvqejPAY/edit#heading=h.kv09dibi95bt).
