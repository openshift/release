# art_input_images.py:220 added the following resource
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ART usually builds containers based off an custom updated ubi7 or 8 image (i.e. packages are 
# more up-to-date than the ubi images on registry.access. We want upstream CI
# builds to use base images as close to the ART base as possible. To that end, 
# ART will mirror its base images to api.ci. However, we cannot use these images directly
# for CI. On top of the ART images, we need to create yum repositories configuration 
# files that will allow CI builds access to the same repositories available during an ART
# build (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GqmPMzeZ0CmVZhdKF_Q_TdRqx_63TIRboO4uvqejPAY/edit#heading=h.kv09dibi95bt).
# 
# This build creates a RHEL-8 base image for CI for OpenShift 4.7.
