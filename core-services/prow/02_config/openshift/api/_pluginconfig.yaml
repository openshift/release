    Hello @{{.AuthorLogin}}! Some important instructions when contributing to {{.Org}}/{{.Repo}}:
    API design plays an important part in the user experience of OpenShift and as such API PRs are subject to a high level of scrutiny to ensure they follow our best practices. If you haven't already done so, please review the [OpenShift API Conventions](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/dev-guide/api-conventions.md) and ensure that your proposed changes are compliant.  Following these conventions will help expedite the api review process for your PR.
