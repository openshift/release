    Hello @{{.AuthorLogin}}! Some important instructions when contributing to {{.Org}}/{{.Repo}}:
    API design plays an important part in the user experience of OpenShift and as such API PRs are subject to a high level of scrutiny to ensure they follow our best practices. If you haven't already done so, please review the [OpenShift API Conventions](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/dev-guide/api-conventions.md) and ensure that your proposed changes are compliant.  Following these conventions will help expedite the api review process for your PR.

    For merging purposes, this repository follows the no-Feature-Freeze process which means that in addition to the standard ``lgtm`` and ``approved`` labels this repository requires either:

    ``bugzilla/valid-bug`` - applied if your PR references a valid bugzilla bug

    OR

    ``qe-approved``, ``docs-approved``, and ``px-approved`` - these labels can be applied by anyone in the openshift org via the ``/label <labelname>`` command.

    Who should apply these qe/docs/px labels?
    - For a no-Feature-Freeze team who is merging a feature before code freeze, they need to get those labels applied to their api repo PR by the appropriate teams (i.e. qe, docs, px)
    - For a Feature Freeze (traditional) team who is merging a feature before FF, they can self-apply the labels (via /label commands), they are basically irrelevant for those teams
    - For a Feature Freeze team who is merging a feature after FF, the PR should be rejected barring an exception
