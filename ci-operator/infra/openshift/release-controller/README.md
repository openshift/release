release-controller
==================

Source code for the controller is at https://github.com/openshift/release-controller

The release-controller automatically builds OpenShift release images when new images are created
for a given OpenShift release. It detects changes to an image stream, launches a job to build
and push the release payload image using `oc adm release new`, and then runs zero or more ProwJobs 
against the artifacts generated by the payload (passed as ENV vars to the ProwJob containers).
If all prow jobs pass, the release is considered Accepted and any artifacts are promoted elsewhere.
Any failures result in the release being marked a failure.

Supported verification steps:

1. ProwJob defined in the `ci-operator/jobs/openshift/release/openshift-release-periodics.yaml` folder
2. Future: Manual
3. Future: Webhook?

Supported publish methods:

1. Update a branch image stream tag to point to the release image stream tag.
2. Future: Mirror to DockerHub or Quay

Releases are given names as a UTC timestamp `20060504010203` based on when they were created.
Data about the release is tracked as an annotation on the release image stream tag.

### Artifacts created:

* In the `--release-namespace`:
  * An image stream with the release name that contains the snapshot of the release image stream
  * An image stream tag with the release name on the `release` image stream
  * An image stream tag on the `release` image stream as a result of a publish step that points to the release tag
* In the `--job-namespace`:
  * A Kubernetes `Job` that builds the release payload and then pushes it to `<release-namespace>/release`
* In the `--prow-namespace`:
  * One ProwJob and pod for each verification step defined on a release, for each release tag. They are prefixed with the release name.

### Admin actions:

To see details about an image stream tag:

    $ oc get is -n openshift release -o yaml

To abort/remove a release tag:

    $ oc delete istag -n openshift release:<release_name>
