# This controls generation of the mirror stanzas for image streams within this directory. Each stream can be published
# to multiple locations, and each source image can be tagged multiple times
targets:
- name: Public Origin Images
  # The list of output version strings (per input source image).
  versions:
  - "{stream}"
  - "{stream}.0"
  # If specified, the stream name that will get tagged as latest.
  version_latest: "4.5"
  # The destination name for each source image.
  # - {image} is the name of the image within a stream
  # - {version} is the destination name as determined by the release (generally '4.5', '4.5.0', and 'latest' if master)
  patterns:
  - quay.io/openshift/origin-{image}:{version}
  # Images in these locations take priority over images here because they include public versions.
  # - {stream} is inferred from the name of the image stream
  override_from:
  - origin/{stream}
  # Thes names images are never pulled from the source (they can however be provided by the override). They are
  # string matches within the name. Use this to prevent images that contain private source from being
  # exposed to a public audience.
