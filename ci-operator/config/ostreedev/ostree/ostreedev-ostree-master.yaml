# With this we build a container image derived from cosa-buildroot
# that contains new binaries.  From there...since this
# cluster doesn't support recursive containerization or virt,
# we can't do much interesting to test it today.  But hopefully
# that will soon change.

# FIXME: change this to build-check.sh as soon as we debug the libarchive test suite failure
