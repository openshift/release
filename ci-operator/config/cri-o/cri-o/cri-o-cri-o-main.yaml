    # We want to test the PR using the code from it. Now, this repo ships RPMs
    # which are normally part of RHCOS. We need to make sure that RHCOS itself
    # is updated with the freshly built RPMs from the PR run. To do this, we do a
    # multi-stage build: the first stage downloads the RPMs that were just built
    # (the `base-machine-with-rpms` contains the RPMs), and the second stage
    # installs the RPMs into RHCOS (this uses the fact that RHCOS is now a native
    # bootable container).
