    # Container image used to build RHCOS in Prow build step to be able to push
    # it and use it as a native container image for other jobs in Prow CI.
    #
    # This stage thus builds the RHCOS OCI image just like the test jobs do
    # before the tests. However, due to limitations within OpenShift CI, we
    # need to do the following:
    # 1. Disable KVM by using the COSA_NO_KVM env var. This is due to OpenShift
    # CI using the default OpenShift Docker Build strategy, which precludes us
    # from mounting /dev/kvm into the build context.
    # 2. Due to a limitation in the version of Buildah that OpenShift Builds
    # uses (at the time of this writing, it uses a v1.23.z version of Buildah),
    # we cannot mount the build context into the container build (e.g., `RUN
    # --mount=type=bind,rw=true,src=.,dst=/buildcontext,bind-propagation=shared
    # <cmd>`), which would allow it to mutate the build context. This is due to
    # https://github.com/containers/buildah/pull/3548 not being present.
    # For now, this necessitates passing this image into the cosa-build image
    # build below to extract the OCI archive and inject it into the
    # ImageStream. However, once the OpenShift CI system is upgraded to use
    # OpenShift 4.11, we can create the RHCOS image in a single shot via this
    # stage.

    # https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/7-transports-features

    # absolute path to refer to the OCI archive in the build context allows us
    # to "import" the OCI archive into the CI ImageStream.
