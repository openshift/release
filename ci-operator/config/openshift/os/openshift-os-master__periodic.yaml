    # This makes use of the following:
    # - OpenShift Image Builds allows one to pass in a path from another container
    # image. It places this under /tmp/build/inputs/<path>. See:
    # https://github.com/openshift/builder/blob/37525a77fa07e26c420962dee47193d672ef0b35/pkg/build/builder/common.go#L72
    # - Buildah allows one to use oci-archive as a transport. See:
    # https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/7-transports-features
    # - Utilizing the above features in concert with one another and using an
    # absolute path to refer to the OCI archive in the build context allows us
    # to "import" the OCI archive into the CI ImageStream.
