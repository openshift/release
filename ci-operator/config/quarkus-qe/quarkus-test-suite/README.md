## General Information

- **TestRepository**: [quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite)

## Purpose

To provision the necessary infrastructure and using that infrastructure to execute quarkus interop tests. The results of these tests will be reported to the appropriate sources following execution.

## Process

The Quarkus Interop scenario can be broken into the following basic steps:

1. Provision a test cluster on AWS
2. Deploy and Execute tests and archive results
3. Deprovision the test cluster

### Cluster Provisioning and Deprovisioning: `ipi-aws`

Please see the [`ipi-aws`](https://steps.ci.openshift.org/workflow/ipi-aws) documentation for more information on this workflow. This workflow is not maintained by the Interop QE team.

### Test Setup, Execution, and Reporting Results - `quarkus-interop-aws`

Following the test cluster being provisioned, the following dockerfile is used to execute tests:

- The dockerfile to build the image and execute tests is defined at https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-test-suite/blob/main/.openshift-interop/Dockerfile.

## Prerequisite(s)

### Environment Variables

- `BASE_DOMAIN`
  - **Definition**: A fully-qualified domain or subdomain name. The base domain of the cloud provider is used for setting baseDomain variable of the install configuration of the cluster.
  - **If left empty**: The [`ipi-aws` workflow](../../../step-registry/ipi/aws/ipi-aws-workflow.yaml) will fail.
- `FIREWATCH_CONFIG`
  - **Definition**: The firewatch [configuration](https://github.com/CSPI-QE/firewatch/blob/main/docs/cli_usage_guide.md#defining-the-configuration) needed for firewatch tool to creates Jira issues for failed OpenShift CI jobs.
