    Destroys Windows BYOH nodes provisioned by windows-byoh-provision step.

    This step:
    1. Uses pre-built terraform-windows-provisioner image (ci/terraform-windows-provisioner:latest)
    2. Accesses Terraform state from ${ARTIFACT_DIR}/terraform_byoh/ (created by provision step)
    3. Runs byoh.sh destroy to clean up resources using Terraform

    Note: ARTIFACT_DIR is used for terraform state persistence because SHARED_DIR points to
    the cluster-profile secret mount which is not shared between steps.
