# CI Operator Step Registry

The step registry holds definitions of steps, chains and workflows for re-use in
`ci-operator` multi-stage jobs. Definitions of terms and expected format can be
found in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1md-1BMf4_7mtKgGVoeZ3jOh4zSIBSjwl6vTTAYESwIM/edit#heading=h.x9snb54sjlu9).

TODO(apavel): update here to link to better documentation and the UI when it's ready
