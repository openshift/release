    The Openshift E2E GCP workflow executes the upgrade end-to-end test suite on GCP with a default cluster configuration and Loki as log collector, exercising an upgrade during the process.
    Installer from latest release is used instead. This workflow is intended to verify that changes in installer PR can be used to upgrade the cluster later on.
