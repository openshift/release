    The Openshift E2E oVirt upgrade release-4.6,4.7 workflow installs OpenShift cluster on top of oVirt
    from releases that didn't contain affinity groups and secure connection to the oVirt engine from the installer,
    therefor it uses a different install config and ovirt-config.
    Executes an upgrade to the next available version.
