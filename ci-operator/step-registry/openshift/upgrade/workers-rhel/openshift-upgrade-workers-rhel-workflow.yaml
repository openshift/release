    The Openshift E2E AWS workflow initializes RHEL Workers using ansible playbooks. After a successful install, this workflow will upgrade the workers using another ansible playbook.
    This workflow is intended to verify that changes in openshift-ansible PRs can be used to upgrade the cluster later on.
