    The chain executes upgrade-prepare, which creates test data on the cluster;
    then upgrade the HyperShift HostedCluster(CP);
    then upgrade the HyperShift NodePool(worker node);
    then downgrade the HyperShift HostedCluster(CP);
    then downgrade the HyperShift NodePool(worker node);
    then execute upgrade-check, which checks the prepared test data.
