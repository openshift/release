    This will startup a VM with the base OCP version specified by RECIPIENT_VERSION and do an image based upgrade.

    In order to do a cluster upgrade, this step will use the configured EC2 host to setup a VM, install Openshift in the VM with the lifecycle agent operator.
    The resulting cluster will be upgraded using the specified seed image.
