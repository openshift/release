      Override the pipeline OLM LCA bundle build with a custom OLM LCA operator bundle image.

      The LCA image is included in the seed image and by using the pipeline LCA image the seed image cannot be used outside this pipeline.
      This override is useful when the seed image generated by this job is to be used by another job on a separate workflow that does not
      have access to this pipeline's build server registry.

      Override the pipeline Recert build with a custom Recert image.

      The Recert image is included in the seed image and by using the pipeline Recert image the seed image cannot be used outside this pipeline.
      This override is useful when the seed image generated by this job is to be used by another job on a separate workflow that does not

    This will create the seed image for use with IBU.

    In order to create the seed image, this step will use the configured EC2 host to setup a VM, install Openshift in the VM and generate the seed image.
    The resulting image will be pushed to quay and can be used to upgrade another cluster
