      # 4) Cilium needs a special setting to pass pod-label update test, skip for now

      # 5) known Cilium issue
      #    https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/10002
      # 6) skip maxUnavailable test as openshift-kube-proxy doesn't pass it
      # 7) skip /config/master test (pending investigation)
      # 8,9,10,11) pending investigation from Cilium team
      # 12) regression - openshift-test should skip unidling tests on non-OpenshiftSDN CNIs
      TEST_SKIPS: >-
        NetworkPolicy between server and client should not allow access by TCP when a policy specifies only SCTP\|
        NetworkPolicy between server and client should allow egress access to server in CIDR block\|
        NetworkPolicy between server and client should ensure an IP overlapping both IPBlock.CIDR and IPBlock.Except is allowed\|
        NetworkPolicy between server and client should deny ingress access to updated pod\|
        Services should be rejected when no endpoints exist\|
        Managed cluster should only include cluster daemonsets that have maxUnavailable update of 10 or 33 percent\|
        Pods cannot access the /config/master API endpoint\|
        Services should be able to update service type to NodePort listening on same port number but different protocols\|
        Services should respect internalTrafficPolicy=Local Pod to Pod\|
        Services should respect internalTrafficPolicy=Local Pod (hostNetwork: true) to Pod\|
