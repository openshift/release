    The Openshift E2E oVirt `csi` release 4.6,4.7 workflow installs OpenShift cluster on top of oVirt
    from releases that didn't contain affinity groups and secure connection to the oVirt engine from the installer,
    therefor it uses a different install config and ovirt-config.
    Executes the `openshift/csi` end-to-end test suite.
    Volume resizing tests are disabled, releases 4.6,4.7 doesn't support volume resizing.
