    The Openshift E2E oVirt e2e release 4.6,4.7 workflow installs OpenShift cluster on top of oVirt
    from releases that didn't contain affinity groups and secure connection to the oVirt engine from the installer,
    therefor it uses a different install config and ovirt-config.
    Executes the `openshift/conformance/parallel` end-to-end test suite.
