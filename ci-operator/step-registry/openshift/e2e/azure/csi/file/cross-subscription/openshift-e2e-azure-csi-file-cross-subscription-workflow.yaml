  documentation: |-
    The Openshift E2E Azure `csi` workflow executes the `openshift/csi` end-to-end test suite on Azure File CSI driver that was installed during cluster setup.
    This workflow creates a cluster in one Azure subscription (Subscription A) and provisions Azure File shares in another (Subscription B). Therefore, the service principal must be granted the required roles on Subscription B to ensure proper access.
