    Installs the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator via OLM.

    This step:
    1. Creates the openshift-nfd namespace
    2. Creates an OperatorGroup for the namespace
    3. Subscribes to the nfd package from the redhat-operators catalog
    4. Waits for the operator CSV to reach Succeeded phase
    5. Creates a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR instance
    6. Waits for NFD to become available

    Prerequisites:
    - OpenShift cluster with GPU-enabled worker nodes
    - redhat-operators catalog available in openshift-marketplace

    This step is REQUIRED before GPU Operator installation to ensure GPU nodes
    are properly labeled with nvidia.com/gpu.present=true before DRA tests run.
