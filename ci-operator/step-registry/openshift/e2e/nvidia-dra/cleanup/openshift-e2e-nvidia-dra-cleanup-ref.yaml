    Cleans up NVIDIA GPU stack components installed during testing.

    This step removes:
    - NVIDIA DRA Driver (Helm release)
    - NVIDIA GPU Operator (Helm release)
    - Associated namespaces and ClusterRoleBindings
    - Test resources (DeviceClasses, ResourceClaims)

    The cleanup is optional on success, meaning it will always run on failure
    but can be skipped on success to preserve the environment for debugging.
