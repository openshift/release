      The type of test to perform.
      * 'suite' - Run the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE. By default this executes the
                  OpenShift parallel conformance suite. All product components must run the
                  default suite on pull requests prior to merge.
      * 'conformance-parallel' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product conformance/parallel
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
      * 'conformance-serial' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product conformance/serial
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
      * 'upgrade' - Perform an upgrade to the image defined by OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE.
                  The TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS flag may be optionally set. All product components
                  must run the default upgrade test (verify an upgrade completes) on pull requests
                  prior to merge.
      * 'jenkins-e2e-rhel-only' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product jenkins-e2e-rhel-only
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
      * 'image-ecosystem' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product image-ecosystem
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
