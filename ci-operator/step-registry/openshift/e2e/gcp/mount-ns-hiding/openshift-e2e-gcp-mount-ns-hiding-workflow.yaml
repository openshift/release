      The Openshift E2E mount namespace hiding workflow executes the common end-to-end test
      suite with the OVNKubernetes network plugin. The mount namespace hiding feature is
      controlled by MOUNT_NS_HIDING_ENABLED. In OCP 4.12, the feature defaults to being
      disabled, thus this workflow explicitly enables it.
