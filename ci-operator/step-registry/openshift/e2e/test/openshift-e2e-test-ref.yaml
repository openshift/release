  - name: TEST_TYPE
    default: "suite"
    documentation: |
      The type of test to perform.

      * 'suite' - Run the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE. By default this executes the
                  OpenShift parallel conformance suite. All product components must run the
                  default suite on pull requests prior to merge.
      * 'suite-conformance' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product conformance
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
      * 'upgrade' - Perform an upgrade to the image defined by OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE.
                  The TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS flag may be optionally set. All product components
                  must run the default upgrade test (verify an upgrade completes) on pull requests
                  prior to merge.
      * 'upgrade-conformance' - Performs the 'upgrade' test and then executes the full conformance
                  suite after upgrade completes. Does not honor TEST_SUITE but will respect
                  TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS. All product releases must pass the conformance suite after
                  an upgrade completes or have explicit logic in their test to tolerate behavior after
                  upgrade.
      * 'upgrade-paused' - Perform an upgrade to the images defined by OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE with paused worker pool.
  - name: TEST_SUITE
    default: openshift/conformance/parallel
    documentation: The test suite to run.  Use 'openshift-test run --help' to list available suites.
  - name: TEST_UPGRADE_SUITE
    default: all
    documentation: The test suite to run in upgrade tests.  Use 'openshift-test run --help' to list available suites.
  - name: TEST_SKIPS
    default: ""
    documentation: |
      Regular expression (POSIX basic regular expression) of tests to skip.
      It is suggested to test the regex to make sure that it matches with the available tests.
      Tests can be listed by using 'openshift-tests run --dry-run (...)'. Sometimes, the tests
      that are printed in Prow won't exactly match the list returned by openshift-tests.
  - name: TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS
    default: ""
    documentation: Options controlling how an upgrade is performed. See `openshift-test run-upgrade --help` for more details.
  - name: TEST_REQUIRES_SSH
    default: ""
    documentation:
      If the test suite requires SSH access, setting this variable will install a bastion and configure
      the Kube e2e test infrastructure to use the bastion. Otherwise, tests that require SSH will fail because
      OpenShift does not expose SSH to nodes by default.
  - name: TEST_INSTALL_CSI_DRIVERS
    default: ""
    documentation: The CSI driver(s) to use.  Used by the `openshift-tests` program, see its documentation for details.
  - name: TEST_CSI_DRIVER_MANIFEST
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Name of the CSI driver manifest file to use.  Used by the `openshift-tests`
      program as TEST_CSI_DRIVER_FILES env. var., see its documentation for
      details. The file must be present in ${SHARED_DIR}.
  - name: TEST_IMAGE_MIRROR_REGISTRY
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Defines the location of a pull-through cache to be used by e2e tests which directly pull an image. When defined, targeted
      tests will pull from the specified registry.  This variable is intended to be used for 4.6 configurations where the
      docker.io rate limit results in failing CI jobs.  Note: This variable is only honored for `openshift-tests` built from
      the release-4.6 branch.  This configuration is intended to be made in concert with an associated mirror configuration
      to the cluster under test.
  - name: AWS_EDGE_POOL_ENABLED
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Flag to enable the AWS Edge compute pool. This flag is AWS-specific when deploying nodes in Local Zone using the 'edge' compute
      pool option in install-config.yaml, or when the subnets in Local Zones have been provided. EC2 Instances in Local Zones usually takes
      longer to be ready (Node Ready), so it requires longer time to wait for Node VS Machine count. This flag will extend three times
      than the regular cluster, so it would prevent the monitor to fail before starting the tests.
  - name: TEST_SDN_LIVE_MIGRATION_OPTIONS
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      This flag enables the migration from one network provider to another. Following successful migration,
      it tests that the cluster is stable. Default is blank which means no live migration will be triggered.
      Valid entry is one or more key=value seperated by a comma. Valid keys are 'target-cni' and 'rollback'.
      'target-cni' denotes which network provider we want to migrate to. This key is required, otherwise tests are skipped.
      For 'target-cni', a valid value is 'OpenShiftSDN' or 'OVNKubernetes'. Following successful migration to a network provider,
      you may perform rollback to the initial network provider. For 'rollback', valid value is 'true' or 'false'. This key is optional.
