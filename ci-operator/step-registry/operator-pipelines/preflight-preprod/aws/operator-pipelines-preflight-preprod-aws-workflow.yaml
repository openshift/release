    This workflows installs a cluster with a default configuration on AWS and
    executes the Preflight tool against the provisioned cluster.
    Important: Parameter values in `env` are supposed to be used only in rehearsals
    and serve as "testing defaults". Production jobs should always override them
    via `preflight-trigger`.
