      This step will execute the Preflight utility against a target certification test asset.
      Preflight STDOUT is suppressed, and log file always pushed to the SHARED_DIR as a tarball
      called preflight.tar.gz. This is to encourage the secure transmission of those assets in a
      follow up step for this task.

      Optionally, setting PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS=true when calling this task will immediately push preflight
      artifacts and logfiles to the ARTIFACT_DIR which is searchable on prow.ci.openshift.org.
