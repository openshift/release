    This workflows perform shared pre/post actions on clusters obtained from
    preinstalled pools (https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#testing-with-a-cluster-from-a-cluster-pool).
    Claims a cluster with a default configuration on AWS and executes the Preflight
    tool against a provided asset.
    Important: Parameter values in `env` are supposed to be used only in rehearsals
    and serve as "testing defaults". Production jobs should always override them
    via `preflight-trigger`.
