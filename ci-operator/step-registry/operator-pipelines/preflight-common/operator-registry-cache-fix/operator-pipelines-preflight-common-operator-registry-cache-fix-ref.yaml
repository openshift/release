      This step is temporary to fix an issue with Hive managed 4.15.x clusters. When clusters are
      woken from hibernation one or more catalagsource pods are caught in CrashLoopBackoff. In
      order to resolve we simply check the status of all catalogsource pods in openshift-marketplace
      and if any pod has status CrashLoopBackoff we delete the pod and wait for another to replace it.
