    Run the complete DPF test suite including DPU services validation,
    network connectivity tests, and comprehensive system checks.
    
    This step:
    1. Runs DPF sanity checks (make run-dpf-sanity)
    2. Validates DPU service deployments
    3. Tests network connectivity and OVN functionality  
    4. Verifies HyperShift hosted cluster operation
    5. Performs workload deployment tests
    6. Validates BFB and firmware functionality
    
    The test suite includes:
    - Basic cluster functionality validation
    - DPF operator health checks
    - DPU services connectivity tests
    - Network policy and OVN validation
    - Workload scheduling on DPU nodes
    - Performance and resource utilization checks
    
    Expected duration: 1.5-2 hours
    Test results and logs are saved to artifacts for analysis.
