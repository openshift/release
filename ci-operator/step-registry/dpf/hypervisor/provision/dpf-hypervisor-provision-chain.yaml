    Provision chain that sets up SSH access to hypervisor, prepares the 
    environment with secrets and configuration, and deploys the OpenShift 
    cluster with DPF using the automation scripts.
    
    Chain steps:
    1. dpf-hypervisor-setup-ssh: Configure SSH access to nvd-srv-45
    2. dpf-hypervisor-prepare-environment: Copy code, secrets, and config
    3. dpf-hypervisor-deploy-cluster: Execute 'make all' to deploy cluster
    
    After successful completion, the cluster will be ready for testing
    with kubeconfig available in ${SHARED_DIR}/kubeconfig.
    
    This provision chain typically takes 4-6 hours to complete the full
    deployment including cluster creation, VM provisioning, and DPF
    operator installation.
