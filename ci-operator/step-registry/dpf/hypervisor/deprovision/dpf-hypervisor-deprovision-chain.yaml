    Deprovision chain that cleans up the DPF cluster and temporary files
    on the hypervisor after testing completes.
    
    Chain steps:
    1. dpf-hypervisor-cleanup: Delete cluster, VMs, and working directory
    
    This cleanup runs in the 'post' phase and executes regardless of test
    success or failure to ensure resources are properly released.
    
    The deprovision process is designed to be thorough but non-blocking,
    ensuring the hypervisor is clean and ready for the next CI run.
