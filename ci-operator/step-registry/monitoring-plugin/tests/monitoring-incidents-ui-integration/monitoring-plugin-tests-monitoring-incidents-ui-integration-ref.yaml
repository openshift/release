    The monitoring-plugin-tests-monitoring-incidents-ui-integration step executes the Monitoring Console Plugin Incidents Cypress tests.
    This step clones the monitoring-plugin repository at runtime and runs the incidents tests from there, making it suitable
    for use in pipelines that don't build the monitoring-plugin itself.
