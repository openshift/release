        The AWS region to use. The KinD AMI is only available in us-east-1,
        us-east-2, us-west-1, and us-west-2.
  documentation: |-
    This step creates AWS VM created to run KinD based tests. The IP address for
    the VM is stored in ${SHARED_DIR}/public_ip. The SSH private key is stored
    in ${SHARED_DIR}/private.pem. Because of the way Prow creates the shared
    directory, the private key file will have 644 permissions when your test
    starts. You will need to run `chmod 400 "${SHARED_DIR}/private.pem"`
    before you use the private key file with ssh.
