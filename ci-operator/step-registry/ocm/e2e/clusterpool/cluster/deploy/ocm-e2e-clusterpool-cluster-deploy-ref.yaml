    - name: MAKEFILE
      default: "/opt/build-harness/Makefile.prow"
      documentation: |-
        Location of the build harness Makefile for use on OSCI.
    - name: CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE
      default: "cluster-claims"
      documentation: |-
        File name that has the cluster claim names.
    - name: CLUSTER_INCLUSION_FILTER
      default: "^hub-"
      documentation: |-
        A filter used by grep to pick a set of cluster claims from the
        CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE to deploy to. If empty, all clusters will be included.
        By default, ACM will only be deployed to hub clusters.
    - name: CLUSTER_EXCLUSION_FILTER
      default: ""
      documentation: |-
        A filter used by grep to eliminate a set of cluster claims from the
        CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE to deploy to. This filter is applied after the
        CLUSTER_INCLUSION_FILTER. If empty, no clusters will be excluded.
        By default, ACM will only be deployed to hub clusters.
    - name: CLUSTER_NAMES
      default: ""
      documentation: |-
        A comma separated list of cluster claims to deploy to. The names are
        matched after stripping the suffix from the cluster claim name. If a
        metadata file for one of the names is not found, this step will throw
        an error
        
        If set, this overrides CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE, CLUSTER_INCLUSION_FILTER,
        and CLUSTER_EXCLUSION_FILTER.
        
        The special value "none" can be used to indicate that no deploy is to
        take place.
    - name: DEPLOY_TIMEOUT
      default: "1800"
      documentation: |-
        The timeout, in seconds, to wait for an ACM delployment to complete
        before cancelling it.
    - name: COMPONENT_NAME
      default: ""
      documentation: |-
        The name of the component used in manifest files. If not given, the
        value stored in the file COMPONENT_NAME will be used. It can be
        overridden here if you're using another component from your repo
        such as an end-to-end test image.
    - name: GITHUB_USER
      default: "acm-cicd-prow-bot"
      documentation: |-
        The GitHub user name.
    - name: GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE
      default: "/etc/acm-cicd-github/token"
      documentation: |-
        The file that stores the GitHub token. Should match credentials stanza
        mount path.
    - name: PIPELINE_REPO
      default: "github.com/open-cluster-management/pipeline"
      documentation: |-
        The GitHub repo where CICD pipeline data is stored. Do not include
        the "https://" prefix or the ".git" suffix.
    - name: RELEASE_REPO
      default: "github.com/open-cluster-management/release"
      documentation: |-
        The GitHub repo where ACM release data is stored. Do not include
        the "https://" prefix or the ".git" suffix.
    - name: PIPELINE_STAGE
      default: "edge"
      documentation: |-
        The pipeline stage to use as the base deployment of ACM. Value is
        either "edge" or "integration". An invalid value will cause an error.
    - name: DEPLOY_REPO
      default: "github.com/open-cluster-management/deploy"
      documentation: |-
        The GitHub repo where the ACM deployment code is stored. Do not include
        the "https://" prefix or the ".git" suffix.
    - name: QUAY_TOKEN_FILE
      default: "/etc/acm-cicd-quay-pull/token"
      documentation: |-
        The file that stores the Quay token. Should match credentials stanza
        mount path.
  documentation: |-
    This step deploys ACM on the selected clusters.  All name matching is done
    after stripping the suffix from the cluster claim name. For example, the
    cluster claim name hub-1-abc12 would be reduced to hub-1 before being matched.
    
    Unless CLUSTER_NAMES is set to "none", at least one cluster must be selected
    for deployment.
    
    The latest edge version of ACM for a particular stream (edge or integration)
    will be deployed first. After this version of ACM is running, the CSV CR for
    the multiclusterhub-operator will be modified to use the component image from
    the CI Registry that was built for the PR.
