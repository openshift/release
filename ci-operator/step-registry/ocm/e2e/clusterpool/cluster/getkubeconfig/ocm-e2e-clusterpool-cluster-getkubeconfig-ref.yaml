    This step generates kubeconfig files for the clusters specified by the
    cluster claim names in the file specified by CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE.
    The kubeconfig is stored in "${SHARED_DIR}/${kubeconfig_file_name}".
    The kubeconfig file name is taken from the cluster claim name in the
    cluster-claims file, stripping off the trailing suffix, and adding a .kc
    extension. For example, the cluster claim name hub-1-abc12 would give the
    kubeconfig file name "hub-1.kc".
