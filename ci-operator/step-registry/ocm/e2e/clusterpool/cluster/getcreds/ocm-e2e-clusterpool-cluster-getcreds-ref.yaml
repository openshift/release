    This step generates credential files for the clusters specified by the
    cluster claim names in the file specified by CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE. The
    credential files will be stored in the SHARED_DIR.
    
    The cluster name is taken from the cluster claim name in CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE
    and stripping off the trailing suffix. For example, hub-1-abc12 would become
    hub-1.
    
    The kubeconfig file name is made by taking the cluster name and adding a .kc
    extension. For example, the cluster claim name hub-1-abc12 would give the
    kubeconfig file name "hub-1.kc" and be stored in 'SHARED_DIR/hub-1.kc'.
    
    The metadata file name is made by taking the cluster name and adding a .json
    extension. For example, the cluster claim name hub-1-abc12 would give the
    metadata file name "hub-1.json" and be stored in 'SHARED_DIR/hub-1.json'.
