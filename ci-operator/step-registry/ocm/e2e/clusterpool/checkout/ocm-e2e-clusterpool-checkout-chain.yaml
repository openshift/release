    The ocm-e2e-clusterpool-checkout chain gets a randomized list of possible
    clusterpools and tries to checkout one or more clusters from them.

    Once the clusters are checked out, it will then deploy a recent version of
    ACM on the clusters with the component in the current PR replaced with the
    image built during the PR.
