      documentation: |-
        API URL of the cluster running the target clusterpool, used in oc login,
        so port :6443 is required

    - name: CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_INCLUSION_FILTER
      default: ""
      documentation: |-
        A filter used by grep to select a set of cluster pools to use when
        checking out clusters. If the filter is empty, all cluster pools will
        be used. This filter is applied before the EXCLUSION filter.
    - name: CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_EXCLUSION_FILTER
      default: ""
      documentation: |-
        A filter used by grep to prevent a set of cluster pools from being used
        when checking out clusters. If the filter is empty, no cluster pools
        will be eliminated. This filter is applied after the INCLUSION filter.
    - name: CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_ORDER
      default: "shuffle"
      documentation: |-
        Valid values are "sort" and "shuffle". Any other value leaves the

      documentation: |-
        File name to use for the cluster pool list.
  documentation: |-
    This step queries the cluster pool host for a list of available cluster
    pools, potentially filters and sorts the list of cluster pools, and then
    writes that list to a file in SHARED_DIR.
