    This workflow checks out one or more clusters for use by a test and then
    checks the clusters back in when done.

    These two variable control how many hub and managed clusters will be
    checked out for this test.
    CLUSTERPOOL_HUB_COUNT=1
    CLUSTERPOOL_MANAGED_COUNT=0

    The following environment variables have defaults that will need to be
    changed.
    CLUSTERPOOL_HOST_PROW_KUBE_SECRET=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_HOST_NAMESPACE=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_GROUP_NAME=""

    The following environment variables have reasonable defaults.
    MAKEFILE="/opt/build-harness/Makefile.prow"
    CLUSTERPOOL_HOST_API="https://api.collective.aws.red-chesterfield.com:6443"
    CLUSTERPOOL_LIST=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_ORDER="shuffle"
    CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_FILTER=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_LIST_FILE="clusterpool-list"
    CLUSTER_CLAIM_FILE="cluster-claims"

    The following environment variable will need to be overridden if you're
    not using the component name from the COMPONENT_NAME file in your
    component's GitHub repository. For example, using and end-to-end test image.
    COMPONENT_NAME=""
