    This workflow checks out one or more clusters for use by a test and then
    checks the clusters back in when done.
    
    These two variable control how many hub and managed clusters will be
    checked out for this test. The default is one hub and no managed clusters.
    CLUSTERPOOL_HUB_COUNT=1
    CLUSTERPOOL_MANAGED_COUNT=0
    
    The following environment variablesi will need to be set to use the
    correct cluster pool.
    CLUSTERPOOL_HOST_PROW_KUBE_SECRET=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_HOST_NAMESPACE=""
    CLUSTERPOOL_GROUP_NAME=""
    
    The following environment variables have reasonable defaults but you may
    want to override them.
    CLUSTER_INCLUSION_FILTER="^hub-.*"
    CLUSTER_EXCLUSTION_FILTER=""
    CLUSTER_NAMES=""
    DEPLOY_TIMEOUT="900"
    PIPELINE_STAGE="edge"
    
    The following environment variable will need to be overridden if you're
    not using the component name from the COMPONENT_NAME file in your
    component's GitHub repository. For example, using and end-to-end test image.
    COMPONENT_NAME=""
    
    The following environment variables have reasonable defaults that you
    probably won't need to change.
