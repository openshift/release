    This step for creating a rosa sts cluster with configurations.
    Detailed configuration check https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs/blob/main/tests/ci/profiles/tf_cluster_profile.yml.
    RHCS_ENV can be set to staging, production, integration
    GATEWAY_URL will overwrite RHCS_ENV if it is set for a sandbox env maybe
    VERSION is set to latest by default, it will list the supported versions and then use the latest. Or you can set a uniqe value like 4.14.0
    REAGION will use the value set in profile configuration. Otherwise it will use the one in env settings
