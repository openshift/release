    This step for creating a rosa sts cluster with configurations.
    Detailed configuration check https://github.com/terraform-redhat/terraform-provider-rhcs/blob/main/tests/ci/profiles/tf_cluster_profile.yml.
    RHCS_ENV can be set to staging, production, integration
    GATEWAY_URL will overwrite RHCS_ENV if it is set for a sandbox env maybe
    VERSION is set to latest by default, it will list the supported versions and then use the latest. Or you can set a uniqe value like 4.14.0
    REAGION will use the value set in profile configuration. Otherwise it will use the one in env settings
    QE_USAGE will tag our the usage of the created cluster so we can figure our the leak resources
    WAIT_OPERATORS default value is false. If it is set to true, then the setup step will wait for the cluster operators get ready
    RHCS_SOURCE will replace all of the tf manifests files with the env variable value of rhcs source
    RHCS_VERSION will replace all of the tf manifests files with the env variable value of rhcs version
