    This step creates the files necessary to deploy a GCP UPI cluster.
    It requires an existing install-config.yaml to exist in the shared directory with the necessary configuration to deploy a cluster to the GCP CI project.
    It uses this install-config.yaml to generate the Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files with the modifications required to support the GCP UPI workflow.
    These files are copied to the shared directory for future consumption.
