    This step creates the files necessary to deploy a zonal vSphere UPI cluster.
    It requires an existing install-config.yaml to exist in the shared directory with the necessary configuration to deploy a cluster to the vSphere CI project.
    It uses this install-config.yaml to generate the govc.sh, Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files with the modifications required to support the vSphere UPI workflow.
    These files are copied to the shared directory for future consumption.
