    This chain generates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere UPI platform `External` cluster
    with network type OVNKubernetes.
    It creates an install-config.yaml using the ipi-conf-vsphere chain.
    It then modifies the install-config for the ovn and platform `None` configurations.
    After infrastructure resource manifests altering for using the `External` platform type.  
    Then it uses that file to create the Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files.
    These files are copied to the shared dir for future consumption.
