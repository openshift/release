    This step creates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere UPI cluster with platform `External` specified.
    It requires an existing install-config.yaml for the `None` platform to exist in the shared directory to deploy a cluster to the vSphere CI project.
    It uses this install-config.yaml to generate the govc.sh, Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files with the modifications required to support the vSphere UPI workflow.
    These files are copied to the shared directory for future consumption.
    This step mostly replicates `upi-conf-vsphere` and is intended to be used as `upi-conf-vsphere` replacement.
