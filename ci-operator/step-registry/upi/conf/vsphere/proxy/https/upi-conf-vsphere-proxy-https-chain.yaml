    This chain generates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere UPI cluster with https proxy configuration.
    It creates an install-config.yaml using the ipi-conf-vsphere chain, and add proxy section in install-config.yaml
    Then it uses that file to create the Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files.
    These files are copied to the shared dir for future consumption.
