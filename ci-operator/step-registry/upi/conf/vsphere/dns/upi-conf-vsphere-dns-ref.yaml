    Uses VIPs in ${SHARED_DIR}/vips.txt to create route53 dns records. Outputs
    ${SHARED_DIR}/basedomain.txt to ensure consistent basedomain in conf and
    deprovision steps. Saves batch job to delete DNS records to
    ${SHARED_DIR}/dns-delete.json for use in deprovisioning, with the hosted
    zone ID in ${SHARED_DIR}/hosted-zone.txt.
