    This chain generates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere UPI cluster.
    It creates an install-config.yaml using the upi-conf-vsphere chain.
    Then it uses that file to create the Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files.
    These files are copied to the shared dir for future consumption.
