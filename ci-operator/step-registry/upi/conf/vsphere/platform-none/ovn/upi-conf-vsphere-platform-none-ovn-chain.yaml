    This chain generates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere UPI platform none cluster
    with network type OVNKubernetes.
    It creates an install-config.yaml using the ipi-conf-vsphere chain.
    It then modifies the install-config for the ovn and platform none configurations.
    Then it uses that file to create the Ignition, metadata.json, and kubeconfig files.
    These files are copied to the shared dir for future consumption.
