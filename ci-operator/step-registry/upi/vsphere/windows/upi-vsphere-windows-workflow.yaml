    This UPI workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision a Windows OS virtual machine in vSphere, allowing job
    authors to inject their own binaries and end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `upi-vsphere-windows-{pre,post}` chains to allow other workflows to mimic
    and extend this base workflow without a need to backport changes.
