    The UPI workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a platform `External` configuration
    on vSphere.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `upi-vsphere-platform-external-ovn-{pre,post}` chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend
    this base workflow without a need to backport changes.
