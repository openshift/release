    This step deploys a UPI cluster to the IBM Z Ecosystem Cloud, under the CI ibmz-eco project.
    It requires properly configured terraform.tfvars, clouds.yaml, and pull-secret.
    install-config.yaml and ignition files are generated as part of the installation.
    These files are used to deploy a cluster to the IBM Z project using the UPI workflow.
