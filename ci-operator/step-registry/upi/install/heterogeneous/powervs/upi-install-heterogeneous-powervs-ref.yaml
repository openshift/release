      Whether to add the additional workers after the cluster is installed.
      This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important
      for testing single-architectures clusters based on single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.
      Also, at time of writing, the above path is the only one possible for multi-arch clusters with arm64 control plane
      and additional amd64 workers (because the release image is not a manifest list when installing from Prow and 
      this check would fail at installation time if installing an arm64 CP cluster from the multi payload:

      In other cases, one can consider setting this variable to false for reducing the time to complete the provisioning
      of the nodes.
