      Whether to add the additional workers after the cluster is installed.
      This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important
      for testing single-architectures clusters based on single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.
      In other cases, one can consider setting this variable to false for reducing the time to complete the provisioning
      of the nodes.
