    The must-gather step runs the must-gather tool to gather artifacts.
    This is a copy of gather-must-gather step, because we want to run must-gather *before* un-installation of an optional CSI driver (to save the driver logs) and then also *after* driver uninstallation to check that the driver was removed completely (and have logs for it). CI does not allow running the same step twice, we need a copy.
