    The storage-conf-wait-for-csi-driver step waits for a given CSI driver to be fully deployed.
    Since each ClusterCSIDriver uses different conditions, list of the conditions to wait for must
    be provided.
    Unfortunately, it's not possible to wait for a condition to get False, e.g. Progressing=False.
    The driver may not be fully deployed, however, at least one node has the CSI driver installed.
