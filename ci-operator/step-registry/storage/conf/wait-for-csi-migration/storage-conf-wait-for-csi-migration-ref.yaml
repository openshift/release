    storage-conf-csi-migration-enable steps enables alpha feature gates for CSI migration of all
    in-tree volume plugins we have in OCP and waits for the chanegs to be reflected in
    kube-controller-manager and nodes. It expects that there is no volume present on the system
    that would be affected by the migration!
