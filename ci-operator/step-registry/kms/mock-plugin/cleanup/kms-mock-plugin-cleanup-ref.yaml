    Cleans up the mock KMS plugin DaemonSet and related resources.

    This step removes the KMS plugin namespace and all associated resources
    created by kms-mock-plugin-deploy. It's marked as best_effort so failures
    don't block the test run.

    The cleanup includes:
      - KMS plugin namespace and all resources within it
      - Temporary files in SHARED_DIR
