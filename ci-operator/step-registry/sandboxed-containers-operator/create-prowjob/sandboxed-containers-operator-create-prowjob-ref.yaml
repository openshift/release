  - name: OCP_VERSION
    default: "4.19"
    documentation: |-
      OpenShift Container Platform version for which to generate the prowjob
      configuration. Must be in X.Y format (e.g., 4.19, 4.20).
  - name: AWS_REGION_OVERRIDE
    default: "us-east-2"
    documentation: |-
      AWS region to use for AWS. CoCo requires specific instances no in every region.

    default: "1.10.1"
    documentation: |-
      Expected version of the OpenShift Sandboxed Containers operator from the csv of the operator
  - name: INSTALL_KATA_RPM
    default: "true"
    documentation: |-
      Whether to install the Kata containers RPM on worker nodes after kataconfig is applied during the test.
      Set to "false" to skip uploading an rpm and use existing rpm.
  - name: KATA_RPM_VERSION
    default: "3.17.0-3.rhaos4.19.el9"
    documentation: |-
      Specific version of the Kata containers RPM to upload to worker nodes so it can be installed after kataconfig is applied.
      INSTALL_KATA_RPM must be true.
  - name: OSC_CATALOG_TAG
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Specific OSC catalog tag to use for Pre-GA testing. If not provided,
      the script will automatically discover the latest tag matching the
      pattern X.Y[.Z]-epoch_time from the Quay registry.
  - name: PROW_RUN_TYPE
    default: "candidate"
    documentation: |-
      Type of Prow job configuration to generate. Use "candidate" for
      development builds or "release" for production release testing.
      Valid values: candidate, release.
  - name: SLEEP_DURATION
    default: "0h"
    documentation: |-
      How long to keep the test cluster alive after tests complete, useful
      for debugging. Must be 0-12 followed by 'h' (e.g., 2h, 8h).
  - name: TEST_RELEASE_TYPE
    default: "Pre-GA"
    documentation: |-
      Release type for testing configuration. "Pre-GA" enables development
      catalog sources and image mirroring for testing unreleased builds.
      "GA" uses production catalog sources for released versions.
      Valid values: Pre-GA, GA.
  - name: TEST_TIMEOUT
    default: "90"
    documentation: |-
      Maximum time in minutes to allow tests to run before terminating the
      cluster and marking the test as failed. Should be numeric value only.
      Setting this lower can increase failures on Azure

    The sandboxed-containers-operator-create-prowjob step generates OpenShift CI
    prowjob configuration files for the Sandboxed Containers Operator. It creates
    comprehensive test configurations for multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure)
    and workload types (Kata, Peer Pods, Confidential Computing).

    This step is typically used during CI configuration updates to generate new
    prowjob files when operator versions change, new OCP versions are released,
    or testing parameters need to be updated.

    The generated configuration includes:
    - Azure IPI tests for kata, peer-pods, and confidential computing workloads
    - AWS IPI tests for peer-pods and confidential computing workloads
    - Automatic catalog source management for Pre-GA vs GA testing
    - Dynamic discovery of latest catalog tags from Quay registry
    - Comprehensive environment variable configuration for all test scenarios

    For Pre-GA testing, the step automatically:
    - Queries Quay API for the latest OSC and Trustee catalog tags
    - Configures custom catalog sources for development builds
    - Sets up image mirroring for unreleased operator versions

    For GA testing, the step:
    - Uses production catalog sources (redhat-operators)
    - Configures stable, released operator versions
    - Skips development-specific catalog source creation

    The generated prowjob configuration file must be moved to the appropriate
    ci-operator config directory and CI configurations must be regenerated
    using the standard OpenShift release tooling.
