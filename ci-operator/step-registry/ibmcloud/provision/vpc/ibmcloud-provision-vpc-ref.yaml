        This field represents the VPC would be a disconnected network (without NAT gateway), or not.

        How many pairs of subnets (control plane and compute) will be created in a zone. This need to be caculated according to the cidr assignment per vpc zone. Generally the max value is 32.
    - name: APPLY_ALL_SUBNETS
      default:  "yes"
      documentation: |-
        Whether apply all created subnets to cluster installation, by default, it is "yes", if "no", will pick up one pair of subnets from every zone to apply.
    - name: PICKUP_SUBNETS_ORDER
      default:  "ascending"
      documentation: |-
        Determinate how to pick up the created subnets when APPLY_ALL_SUBNETS is "no", especially when NUMBER_SUBNETS_PAIR_PER_ZONE > 1. Other supported value: "descending", "random" and "2Paging".
