    Deploys ipecho service for functional egress IP validation. 
    
    The ipecho service returns the source IP address of incoming requests,
    enabling validation that egress IP traffic actually uses the designated 
    egress IP address rather than just checking infrastructure configuration.
    
    This provides true functional validation of egress IP traffic flow
    by creating an internal target service that reports the actual source
    IP observed for incoming connections from test pods.
