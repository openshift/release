    Enables Multi-Network Policy support on the OpenShift cluster by patching the 
    network operator configuration to set useMultiNetworkPolicy=true.
    
    This step is required before running Multi-Network Policy tests as the feature
    is not enabled by default in OpenShift clusters.
    
    The step:
    - Checks current MNP configuration status
    - Enables useMultiNetworkPolicy if not already enabled
    - Waits for the MultiNetworkPolicy CRD to become available
    - Verifies the configuration is properly applied
