    Execute egress IP tests with external bastion-hosted validation service.
    This chain includes:
    1. Deploy external IP echo service on bastion host
    2. Execute the full egress IP test suite with chaos engineering scenarios
    
    The bastion-hosted external IP echo service enables proper validation of egress IP 
    functionality for external traffic, addressing the limitation that egress IPs only 
    apply to traffic leaving the cluster, not internal cluster traffic.
