    This chain runs the MNP-76500 ACL explosion reproduction test followed by
    comprehensive data-path performance validation to ensure network performance
    is not degraded by the ipBlock consolidation fix.
    
    Test sequence:
    1. MNP ipBlocks loadtest - validates PR #2978 ACL consolidation
    2. AWS security group setup - prepares firewall rules for data-path tests
    3. Data-path tests - network-perf and ingress-perf validation
    
    This ensures that:
    - Large-scale MNP deployments work correctly
    - ACL consolidation doesn't impact data-path performance
    - Network functionality remains intact after MNP stress testing
