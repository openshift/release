    Executes the complete OpenShift QE egress IP test suite.
    
    This chain orchestrates:
    1. Infrastructure setup (egress-assignable nodes, egress IP configuration)
    2. Workload generation (blue/red team egress IP pools with active traffic)
    3. Comprehensive resilience testing (pod disruption and node reboot scenarios)
    
    The test suite validates egress IP functionality under infrastructure
    disruption with active workloads and ensures proper recovery of OVN
    network configuration under load conditions.
