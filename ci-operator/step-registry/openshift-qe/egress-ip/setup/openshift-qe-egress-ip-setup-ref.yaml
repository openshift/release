    Sets up egress IP infrastructure for OpenShift clusters including:
    - Labeling worker nodes as egress-assignable
    - Creating egress IP configurations
    - Validating egress IP assignment
    - Verifying OVN pod status on assigned nodes
    
    This step prepares the cluster for comprehensive egress IP resilience testing.
