    Sets up egress IP configuration for testing.
    
    This step creates the necessary egress IP resources and configures
    worker nodes with egress-assignable labels to enable egress IP
    functionality testing. It validates the cluster setup and ensures
    egress IPs are properly assigned before testing begins.
