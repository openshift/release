    This step executes targeted pod disruption specifically on the OVN pod
    that is handling egress IP traffic on the assigned node.
    
    Unlike generic pod chaos that targets random pods, this step:
    - Targets the specific ovnkube-node pod on the egress IP assigned node
    - Validates proper replacement pod recovery
    - Monitors egress IP assignment changes
    - Measures recovery time and OVN state consistency
    
    This ensures that the chaos testing actually exercises the infrastructure
    responsible for egress IP functionality rather than unrelated components.
