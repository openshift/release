    Comprehensive egress IP resilience testing workflow.
    
    This workflow runs thorough egress IP functionality tests including:
    - Baseline metrics collection and workload traffic generation
    - Pod disruption testing with egress IP consistency validation
    - Node reboot testing with enhanced detection mechanisms  
    - Multi-node egress IP migration scenarios
    - Enhanced OVN metrics collection and analysis
    
    Designed to validate egress IP resilience under various failure
    scenarios and provide detailed performance metrics.
