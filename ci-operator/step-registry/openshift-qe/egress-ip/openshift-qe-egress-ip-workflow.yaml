    Provisions an AWS cluster and runs the OpenShift QE egress IP resilience test suite.
    
    This workflow:
    - Creates an OpenShift cluster on AWS using standard IPI installation
    - Enables QE catalog sources for testing
    - Executes comprehensive egress IP testing including pod disruption and node reboot scenarios
    - Cleans up the cluster resources
    
    The test suite validates egress IP stability under infrastructure disruption
    and generates detailed metrics and artifacts for analysis.
