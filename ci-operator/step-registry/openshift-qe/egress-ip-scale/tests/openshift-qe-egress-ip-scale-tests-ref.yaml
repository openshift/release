    Executes comprehensive scaled egress IP resilience validation after chaos testing.
    
    This step:
    - Validates egress IP functionality across all 5 egress IP configurations
    - Tests egress IP migration and load balancing under scale
    - Measures performance impact of chaos testing on scaled workloads  
    - Collects detailed metrics for scaled network operations
    - Validates proper recovery and reassignment across 10-node cluster
