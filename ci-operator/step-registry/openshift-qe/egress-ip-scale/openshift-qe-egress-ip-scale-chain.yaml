    Comprehensive egress IP scale testing chain for SNAT/LRP rule validation.
    
    This chain orchestrates large-scale egress IP testing with:
    - 10 EgressIP objects
    - 2000 pods total (200 pods per EgressIP)
    - SNAT rule validation (expected: 2000 rules)
    - LRP rule validation (expected: 2000 rules) 
    - EgressIP failover testing and rule cleanup verification
    
    The test validates that:
    1. SNAT rules scale correctly with pod count
    2. LRP rules maintain consistency across EgressIPs
    3. Failover properly migrates rules between nodes
    4. Original nodes clean up SNAT rules (drop to 0) after failover
    
    Designed for comprehensive validation of OVN egress IP
    rule management at enterprise scale.
