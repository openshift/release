    Sets up scaled egress IP infrastructure for chaos testing on a 10-node cluster.
    Current scale: 5 egress IPs, 10 nodes, 20 workloads.
    
    NOTE: Testing hundreds of EIPs will be addressed in a separate PR with
    optimized batch creation, extended timeouts, and enhanced resource allocation.
    
    This step:
    - Configures 10 worker nodes as egress-assignable
    - Creates 5 egress IP configurations distributed across availability zones
    - Sets up test workloads for scale validation
    - Prepares monitoring and metrics collection for scaled testing
    - Validates baseline egress IP functionality across all configurations
