    This step installs the MetalLB operator and configures it for ingress testing.
    It automatically detects the environment (baremetalds or vSphere static IP) and
    configures MetalLB with the appropriate IP address pool:
    - For baremetalds: Uses hardcoded IP range 192.168.111.30-192.168.111.39
    - For vSphere static IP: Dynamically extracts IPs from subnets.json (indices #40-49)
    Creates MetalLB instance, IPAddressPool, and L2Advertisement resources to enable
    load balancer services for ingress testing.
