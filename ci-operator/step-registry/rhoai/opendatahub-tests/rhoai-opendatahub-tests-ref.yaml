    This step runs opendatahub-tests.
    
    Before running the tests, it automatically clones the odh-model-controller 
    repository from the same branch that was used to build the image, runs 
    'kustomize build config/default > install.yaml', and applies the manifests 
    to the cluster using 'oc apply -f install.yaml'.
    
    The branch is determined automatically from Prow environment variables 
    (PULL_BASE_REF or PULL_PULL_REF), falling back to 'main' if not available.
