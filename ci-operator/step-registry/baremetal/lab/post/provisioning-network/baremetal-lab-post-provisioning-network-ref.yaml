      documentation: |-
        The IP address or FQDN of the provisioning host. It is the target executor of the installation process.
        The provisioning host will also get the configuration of the provisioning network.
        The provisioning host and the auxiliary host may be the same host, but the provisioning host's instruction set
        architecture must match the one of the cluster nodes and is not supported for multi-arch compute nodes 
        scenarios yet.
