      Number of additional workers. When testing multi-arch compute nodes clusters, this should be set to the desired
      number of additional workers for the non-default architecture to add to the cluster. This can only work with
      payload images that support multi-arch.

      Whether to add (power on) the additional workers after the cluster is installed.
      This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important
      for testing single-architectures clusters based on single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.
      Also, at time of writing, the above path is the only one possible for multi-arch clusters with arm64 control plane
      and additional amd64 workers (because the release image is not a manifest list when installing from Prow and 
      this check would fail at installation time if installing an arm64 CP cluster from the multi payload:

    The baremetal-lab-upi-install will provision a UPI baremetal cluster, given the configuration assets
    prepared in the earlier steps. 
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-upi-conf-base.
    Users that want implement their specific installation configuration should implement workflows that execute 
    (1) the baremetal-lab-upi-conf-base chain, 
    (2) a set of custom chains/steps to either patch the install-config.yaml or define custom manifest_*.yaml files that will be included in install-dir/manifests, to be consumed by the installer,
    (3) the baremetal-lab-upi-install step.
