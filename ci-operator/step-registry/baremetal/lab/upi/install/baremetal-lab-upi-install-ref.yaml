    The baremetal-lab-upi-install will provision a UPI baremetal cluster, given the configuration assets
    prepared in the earlier steps. 
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-upi-conf-base.
    Users that want implement their specific installation configuration should implement workflows that execute 
    (1) the baremetal-lab-upi-conf-base chain, 
    (2) a set of custom chains/steps to either patch the install-config.yaml or define custom manifest_*.yaml files that will be included in install-dir/manifests, to be consumed by the installer,
    (3) the baremetal-lab-upi-install step.
