        Whether to add (power on) the additional workers after the cluster is installed. And the default value is "true"
        when ADDITIONAL_WORKERS > 0, "false" is not supported in ABI. This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node
        clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important for testing single-architectures clusters based on
        single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.

    This step will use the QE baremetal host service to setup the DHCP/PXE and GRUB2 configs for BM UPI/IPI
    installations on infrastructure leveraging the self managed network topology.
