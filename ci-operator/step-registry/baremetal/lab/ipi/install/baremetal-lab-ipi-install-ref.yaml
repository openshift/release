      The IP address or FQDN of the host that runs the infrastructure services (DHCP, PXE, DNS, Load Balancer).

      The IP address or FQDN of the provisioning host. It is the target executor of the installation process.
      The provisioning host will also get the configuration of the provisioning network.
      The provisioning host and the auxiliary host may be the same host, but the provisioning host's instruction set
      architecture must match the one of the cluster nodes and is not supported for multi-arch compute nodes 
      scenarios yet.

    The baremetal-lab-ipi-install will provision a UPI baremetal cluster, given the configuration assets
    prepared in the earlier steps. 
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-ipi-conf.
    Users that want implement their specific installation configuration should implement workflows that execute 
    (1) the baremetal-lab-ipi-conf chain, 
    (2) a set of custom chains/steps to either patch the install-config.yaml or define custom manifest_*.yaml files that will be included in install-dir/manifests, to be consumed by the installer,
    (3) the baremetal-lab-ipi-install step.
