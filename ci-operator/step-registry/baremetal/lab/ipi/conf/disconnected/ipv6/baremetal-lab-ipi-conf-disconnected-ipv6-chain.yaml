    The baremetal-lab-ipi-conf-disconnected-ipv6 chain manages the provisioning of a particular configuration and only enabled IPv6 for OpenShift bare-metal clusters in RH labs using IPI. 
    Workflows and other chains will be responsible for specific configurations and patches of the installation 
    manifests, and to actually start the clusters rendering.
