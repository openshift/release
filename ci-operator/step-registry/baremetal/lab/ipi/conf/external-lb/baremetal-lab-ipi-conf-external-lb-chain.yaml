    The baremetal-lab-ipi-conf-external-lb chain executes all the steps that provision the common configuration for OpenShift 
    bare-metal clusters to install via IPI in the RH labs but using external-lb( keepalived and haporxy will not be running on cluster). 
    Workflows and other chains will be responsible for specific configurations and patches of the installation manifests, and to actually start the clusters rendering.
