    The baremetal-lab-ipi-conf-nmstate chain executes all the steps that provision the common configuration for OpenShift
    bare-metal clusters to install via IPI in the RH labs but using nmstate manifest to configure ovs-bridge br-ex.
    Workflows and other chains will be responsible for specific configurations and patches of the installation manifests, and to actually start the clusters rendering.
