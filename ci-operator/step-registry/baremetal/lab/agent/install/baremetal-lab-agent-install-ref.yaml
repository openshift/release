    documentation: |
      Number of additional workers. When testing multi-arch compute nodes clusters, this should be set to the desired
      number of additional workers for the non-default architecture to add to the cluster. This can only work with
      payload images that support multi-arch.
  - name: ADDITIONAL_WORKERS_DAY2
    default: "true"
    documentation: |
      Whether to add (power on) the additional workers after the cluster is installed. And the default value is "true"
      when ADDITIONAL_WORKERS > 0, "false" is not supported in ABI. This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node
      clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important for testing single-architectures clusters based on
      single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.

    The baremetal-lab-agent-install will provision a baremetal cluster using the agent installer, given the configuration assets
    prepared in the earlier steps.
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-agent-conf.
    Users that want implement their specific installation configuration should implement workflows that execute
    (1) the baremetal-lab-agent-conf(-*) chain,
    (2) a set of custom chains/steps to either patch the install-config.yaml or define custom manifest_*.yaml files that
      will be included in install-dir/manifests, to be consumed by the installer,
    (3) the baremetal-lab-agent-install step.
