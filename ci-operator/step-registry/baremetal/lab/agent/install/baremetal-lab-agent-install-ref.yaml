    The baremetal-lab-agent-install will provision a baremetal cluster using the agent installer, given the configuration assets
    prepared in the earlier steps. 
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-agent-conf.
    Users that want implement their specific installation configuration should implement workflows that execute 
    (1) the baremetal-lab-agent-conf(-*) chain, 
    (2) a set of custom chains/steps to either patch the install-config.yaml or define custom manifest_*.yaml files that
      will be included in install-dir/manifests, to be consumed by the installer,
    (3) the baremetal-lab-agent-install step.
