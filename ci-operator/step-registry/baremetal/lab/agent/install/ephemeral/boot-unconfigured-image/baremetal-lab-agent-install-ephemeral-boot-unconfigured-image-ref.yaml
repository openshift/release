      Whether to add (power on) the additional workers after the cluster is installed. And the default value is "true"
      when ADDITIONAL_WORKERS > 0, "false" is not supported in ABI. This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node 
      clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important for testing single-architectures clusters based on
      single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.
