    The baremetal-lab-agent-conf-disconnected-proxy chain executes all the steps that provision the common configuration for OpenShift 
    bare-metal clusters to install via the agent install in the RH labs. Workflows and other chains will be responsible
    for specific configurations and patches of the installation manifests, and to actually start the clusters rendering.
    This chain is not meant to be used directly by users, but is needed as a dependency of any other step that creates
    the agent-install.yaml
