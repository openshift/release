    The baremetal-lab-agent-conf-disconnected-day2 chain executes all the steps that provision the common configuration 
    for OpenShift bare-metal clusters to install via the agent install in the RH labs and support the day2 install at 
    the same time. Workflows and other chains will be responsible for specific configurations and patches of the 
    installation manifests, and to actually start the clusters rendering. This chain is not meant to be used directly 
    by users, but is needed as a dependency of any other step that creates the agent-install.yaml
