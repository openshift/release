        Whether to add (power on) the additional workers after the cluster is installed. And the default value is "true"
        when ADDITIONAL_WORKERS > 0, "false" is not supported in ABI. This is useful for testing multi-arch compute node
        clusters as a real day2 operation and is especially important for testing single-architectures clusters based on
        single-architecture payloads migrating to a multi-arch payload.

    The baremetal-lab-agent-conf-dynamic step will generate the agent-config.yaml configuration asset for
    a baremetal cluster using the agent installer.
    The minimum requirement for this step to work is to run it after the chain baremetal-lab-agent-conf.
