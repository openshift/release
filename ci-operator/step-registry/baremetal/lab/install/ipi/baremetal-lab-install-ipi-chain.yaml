    (WIP) The Baremetal IPI pre install chain contains all the steps that provision an OpenShift cluster
    with a default configuration on the bare metal servers in the RH labs.
    TODO: "ipi-conf-baremetal" as the first step (it doesn't exist yet).
    TODO: an "ipi-install" equivalent as last step (it has to run on the provisioning host)
