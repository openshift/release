    The IPI workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a default configuration on AWS,
    allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    This workflow is used to test the egress functionality of the OpenShift cluster.
    It installs the netobserv operator and starts recording the egress traffic.
