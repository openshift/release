    Creates a FlowCollector CR to enable network flow collection.
    This step should be run after the netobserv operator is installed.
    It creates the FlowCollector and waits for it to be ready, along with
    verifying that the flowlogs-pipeline daemonset, netobserv-ebpf-agent daemonset,
    and netobserv-plugin deployment are created.
