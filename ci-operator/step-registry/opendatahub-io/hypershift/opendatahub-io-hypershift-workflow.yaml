    Enhanced HyperShift workflow for OpenDataHub operator testing that provides
    fast cluster provisioning and comprehensive debugging capabilities.
    
    This workflow provides:
    - Fast HyperShift hosted cluster provisioning on AWS
    - Direct operator bundle installation using operator-sdk (no OLM catalog required)
    - Operator installation on the hosted cluster (not management cluster)
    - Complete standard gather-extra collection from hosted cluster
    - Comprehensive debugging artifacts including pod logs, metrics, and cluster state
    - Graceful failure handling with best-effort artifact collection
    
    Key features:
    - Uses operator-sdk for faster installation compared to subscription-based workflows
    - Targets hosted cluster via USE_HOSTED_KUBECONFIG for realistic testing
    - Collects full OpenShift debugging data from hosted cluster using standard gather-extra
    - Maintains compatibility with existing OpenDataHub e2e test infrastructure
    - Optimized for PR validation with quick feedback and comprehensive failure analysis
    
    Use this workflow for reliable HyperShift-based operator testing with production-grade
    debugging capabilities while maintaining fast CI feedback cycles.
