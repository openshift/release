      Set the amount of time, the step must wait at most, before unconditionally forcing the workflow to continue
      with the next steps (MIN: "1 min", default: "30 min", MAX: "72 hours").

    This step allows users to set a sleep duration for their workflows. 
    It differs from the clusterbot-wait one as per the longer timeout allowed. 
    It is to be used for workflows requiring time-intensive manual debugging as manual QE tests ceremonies.
    It only works if you are in a Pull-Request.
