  documentation: |-
    Once you have an OSD cluster, you migth want to share an OCM token so that others (e.g. tests) can edit it.
    It is important to share OCM tokens assigned to users with restricted privileges and ideally only for one specific cluster. This can be achieved by granting ClusterEditor role to such users.
    This step will search the ${CLUSTER_PROFILE_DIR} and if there is any match with ${CLUSTER_EDITOR_PREFIX} it will grant the ClusterEditor role to such a user and share its token as 'OCM_TOKEN' in the secret ${CLUSTER_SECRET} in the namespace ${CLUSTER_SECRET_NS}.
