    Install IBM Fusion Access Operator via custom catalog source.
    
    **Operator Channel:**
    - Using "alpha" channel as this is the active development channel for the IBM Fusion Access Operator
    - The operator provides IBM Storage Scale (formerly Spectrum Scale) integration for OpenShift
    - Reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative/5.2.3
    
    **Installation Process:**
    1. Create namespace (ibm-fusion-access) - isolated operator deployment
    2. Create OperatorGroup - enables operator to watch the namespace
    3. Create CatalogSource - provides operator packages from custom catalog
    4. Create Subscription - installs operator from catalog using specified channel
    5. Wait for CSV (ClusterServiceVersion) - confirms successful operator installation
    
    This step installs the IBM Fusion Access Operator which deploys and manages IBM Storage Scale
    for container-native storage on OpenShift.
