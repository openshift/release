    Configure AWS security groups for IBM Fusion Access Operator and IBM Storage Scale testing.
    This step configures the necessary ports for IBM Storage Scale communication and shared storage access.
    Ports configured by default:
    - 12345: IBM Storage Scale NSD (Network Shared Disk)
    - 1191: IBM Storage Scale GUI
    - 60000-61000: IBM Storage Scale dynamic ports
    This step is optional and will not block the test if it fails.
