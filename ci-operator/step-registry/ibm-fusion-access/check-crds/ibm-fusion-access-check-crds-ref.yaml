    Check IBM Storage Scale CRD availability and provide detailed debugging information.
    
    This step verifies that IBM Storage Scale CRDs are established. CRDs are cluster-scoped
    resources, so no namespace configuration is needed.
    
    This optional step helps diagnose issues with IBM Storage Scale operator installation
    and CRD availability. It will not block the test pipeline if CRDs are not available,
    but provides valuable debugging information for troubleshooting.
