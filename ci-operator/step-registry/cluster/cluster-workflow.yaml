    This workflow installs one or more clusters.
    Currently supports up to 4 clusters. If needed, additional environment variables can be added here.
    Currently supported installations: AWS IPI, AWS OSD, ROSA and Hypershift.

      - AWS credentials should be stored in `.awscred` as `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`
      - OCM token should be stored in `ocm-token`
    After testing, the cluster(s) will be deprovisioned.
