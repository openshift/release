      documentation: >-
        Cluster name and semi-comma-separated string with cluster parameters.
        Example: 'name=cluster1;base_domain=aws.interop.com;platform=rosa;region=us-east-2;version=4.14.0-ec.2;channel-group=candidate;worker_flavor=m5.xlarge'
        To set cluster installation timeout, add `timeout=<timeout>`, for example: 30m, 1h.
        If not provided, the default timeout is 30 minutes.
        Example: 'name=cluster1;base_domain=aws.interop.com;platform=aws;region=us-east-2;version=4.13.1;timeout=45m'

    - name: PULL_SECRET_NAME
      default: ""
      documentation: >-
        Name of pull secret json secret; should be saved under cluster-profile.
        Can be obtained from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local.
        Docker `config.json` file should be saved under cluster secrets with credentials to `registry.ci.openshift.org`.
        Required only for AWS IPI installations.

      default: ""
      documentation: S3 bucket name to store install folder backups.
    - name: S3_BUCKET_PATH

    - name: CLUSTER_NAME_PREFIX
      default: "ci"
      documentation: >-
        Prefix to be added to cluster name along with `RANDOMIZE_CLUSTER_NAME`.
        Currently applicable for a single cluster.
    - name: RANDOMIZE_CLUSTER_NAME
      default: "true"
      documentation: >-
        To randomize cluster name, set to "true" else set to "false".
        If set to "true", cluster name will be randomly generated prefixed with `CLUSTER_NAME_PREFIX`.
        If set to "false", cluster name will be the same as CLUSTER1_CONFIG.

    This step installs cluster(s).
    Currently supports up to 4 clusters. If needed, additional environment variables can be added here.
    Currently supported installations: AWS IPI, AWS OSD, ROSA and Hypershift.
    cluster-profile: 
      - AWS credentials should be stored in `.awscred` as `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`
      - OCM token should be stored in `ocm-token`
    Clusters authentication dir path: `/tmp/clusters-data/<cluster platform>/<cluster name>/<auth>
    This dir is compressed and saved under $SHARED_DIR and should be extracted in the relevant step. Run:
      tar -xzvf "${SHARED_DIR}/clusters_data.tar.gz" --one-top-leve=/tmp/clusters-data
    For example: 
      For CLUSTER1_CONFIG="name=ci-hyper;platform=hypershift;region=us-west-2;version=4.13.4;timeout=1h"
      kubeconfig file will be located under: /tmp/clusters-data/hypershift/ci-hyper/auth/kubeconfig
