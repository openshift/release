## Purpose

To test the managed cluster creation feature of ACM.

> **IMPORTANT**
> You must use the [acm-tests-clc-destroy-ref](../clc-destroy/README.md) as a post step when using this clc-create-ref. If you do not and succeed in running the clc-create-ref then you will leave clusters running on the ACM QE team's cloud.

## Process

- Copies a secret file needed for test into env.
- Sets three dynamic variables based on the ephemeral hub cluster that needs to be provisioned prior to running this.
- Runs a [script from product QE's repo](https://github.com/stolostron/clc-ui-e2e/blob/main/execute_clc_interop_commands.sh) that does some additional config and ultimately runs the  script ([start-tests.sh](https://github.com/stolostron/clc-ui-e2e/blob/main/start-tests.sh)) to kick off a cypress test where we install managed-clusters.

## Requirements


### Infrastructure

- A provisioned test cluster to target (hub).
- "advanced-cluster-management" operator installed (see [`install-operators`](../../../step-registry/install-operators/README.md)).
- MCH custom resource installed (see [acm-mch step](../mch/README.md))

### Environment Variables

- Please see [acm-tests-clc-create-ref.yaml](acm-tests-clc-create-ref.yaml) env section.
