      default namespace for applying multicluster hub. Override this in your config env if you want to change it.
  - name: MCH_CATALOG_ANNOTATION
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Whenever MCE operator installation on a cluster requires the use of a non-default catalog source (i.e.; a
      mirror catalog or where there are multiple catalog sources that contain an expected channel for it), a
      special annotation is needed in the MulticlusterHub resource to provide the name of the mirror catalog source
      to the operator. Set this value with your name in that case. Otherwise, the default available catalog will
      be used.
  - name: IMAGE_PULL_SECRET
    default: "multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret"
    documentation: |-
      default image pull secret name. Override this in your config env if you want to change it.
  - name: MCH_AVAILABILITY_CONFIG
    default: "High"
    documentation: |-
      The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster has two availabilities: High and Basic.
      By default, the hub cluster has an availability of High, which gives hub cluster components a
      replicaCount of 2. This provides better support in cases of failover but consumes more resources
      than the Basic availability, which gives components a replicaCount of 1. So it is very important
      that you set spec.availabilityConfig to "Basic" if you are using multicluster engine operator on a
      single-node OpenShift cluster.
