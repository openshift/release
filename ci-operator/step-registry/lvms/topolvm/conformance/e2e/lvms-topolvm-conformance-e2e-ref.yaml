    - name: TEST_SCHEDULER_EXTENDER_TYPE
      default: none
      documentation: |-
        The scheduler extender type to test (TopoLVMs own scheduler extension or the native CSI Storage Capacity Tracking). 
        This defaults to none, meaning Storage Capacity tracking.
    - name: TEST_LVMD_TYPE
      default: embedded
      documentation: |-
        The lvmd type to test (embedded or daemonset). This defaults to embedded.
        The embedded mode runs the lvm2 daemon of TopoLVM in the same binary as the CSI driver daemonset.
        If daemonset, a separate daemonset is deployed to run the lvm2 daemon and communication is done via gRPC.
    - name: KUBERNETES_VERSION
      default: 1.28.0
      documentation: |-
        The version of Kubernetes in Minikube to test against. This defaults to v1.28.0.
        This will result in a different version of the Kubernetes cluster being used in the test.
        TopoLVM always supports a matrix of 3 versions of Kubernetes. It should always be within this matrix.
        See https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm?tab=readme-ov-file#topolvm for details.
  documentation: |-
    This step runs the topolvm conformance tests. These conformance tests are run on minikube
    and expect debian-like tooling so they must be run on a debian derivative machine instead of RHEL.
    This test suite is nevertheless important to keep midstream openshift/topolvm support consistent with
    upstream.
