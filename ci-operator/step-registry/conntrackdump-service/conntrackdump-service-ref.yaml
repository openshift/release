    The conntrackdump-service step deploys a conntrackdump systemd service to collect conntrack session information every second.
    It is useful for debugging network issues that cannot be reproduced live.
    The service is deployed by injecting an installer manifest containing a MachineConfig. This in turn contains
    a script and a systemd unit to run the conntrackdump service script.
    The logs will be present in /var/log/conntrack-dump.
