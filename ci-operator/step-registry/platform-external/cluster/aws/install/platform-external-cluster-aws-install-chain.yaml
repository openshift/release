    This chain contains all of the steps to provision an OpenShift cluster using the AWS UPI workflow
    with custom CloudFormation templates derivated from installer/upi.
    NOTE: This step must not be used outside platform-external provisioning as it must resolve
    dependencies to merge with existing upi deployment steps. For more information, please take a look at
    commands.sh.
