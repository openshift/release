    Waits for CCM to initialize all worker nodes by removing the
    node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint.

    This step addresses a timing issue in external cloud provider (UPI) setups
    where CCM may take longer to initialize nodes compared to integrated platform (IPI).

    Without this wait, the install-complete step may fail because cluster operators
    cannot schedule pods on uninitialized worker nodes, causing timeout failures.

    Timeout: 30 minutes (configurable via MAX_ITERATIONS in script)
