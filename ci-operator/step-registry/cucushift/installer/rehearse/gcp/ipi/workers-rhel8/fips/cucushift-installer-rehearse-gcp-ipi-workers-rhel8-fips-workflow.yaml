    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift fips enabled cluster with RHEL8 compute nodes, allowing job authors 
    to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-workers-rhel8-fips-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
