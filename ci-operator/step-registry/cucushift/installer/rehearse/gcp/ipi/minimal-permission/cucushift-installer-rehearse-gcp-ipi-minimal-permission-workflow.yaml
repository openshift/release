    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with minimum required permissions  
    on GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic. 
    Besides, it uses GCP custom machine type for cluster machines.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-minimal-permission-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
