    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift fips enabled cluster with OVN and ipsec, allowing job authors to inject 
    their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-ovn-ipsec-fips-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
