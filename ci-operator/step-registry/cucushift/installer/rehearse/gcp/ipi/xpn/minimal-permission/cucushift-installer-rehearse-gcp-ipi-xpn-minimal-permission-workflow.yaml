  documentation: "The IPI XPN workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that \nprovision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster into a shared VPC \non GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-xpn-minimal-permission-provision` \nand `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to allow \nother workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without a need \nto backport changes."
