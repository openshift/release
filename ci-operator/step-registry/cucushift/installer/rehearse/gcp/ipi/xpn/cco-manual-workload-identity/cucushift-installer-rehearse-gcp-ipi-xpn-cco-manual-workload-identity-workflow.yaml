  documentation: "The IPI XPN workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and\ndeprovision an OpenShift cluster into a shared VPC \non GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-xpn-cco-manual-workload-identity-{provision,deprovision}` chains to \nallow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without \na need to backport changes."
