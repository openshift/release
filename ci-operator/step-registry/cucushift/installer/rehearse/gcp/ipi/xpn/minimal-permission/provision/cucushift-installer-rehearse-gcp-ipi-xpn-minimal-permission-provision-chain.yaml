    This chain contains all of the steps to provision an OpenShift cluster 
    into GCP shared VPC, using the service account having minimal permissions. 
    The service account doesn't have permissions to create/delete firewall-rules 
    in the host project, so that the pre-configured firewall-rules, rather than 
    installer created ones, will be in use.
