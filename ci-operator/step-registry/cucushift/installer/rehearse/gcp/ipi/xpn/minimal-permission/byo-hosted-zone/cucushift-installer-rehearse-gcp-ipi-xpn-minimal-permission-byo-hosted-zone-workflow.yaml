  documentation: "The IPI XPN workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that \nprovision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster into a shared VPC \non GCP with BYO hosted zone, allowing job authors to inject their own \nend-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-xpn-minimal-permission-byo-hosted-zone-{provision,deprovision}` \nchains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow \nwithout a need to backport changes."
