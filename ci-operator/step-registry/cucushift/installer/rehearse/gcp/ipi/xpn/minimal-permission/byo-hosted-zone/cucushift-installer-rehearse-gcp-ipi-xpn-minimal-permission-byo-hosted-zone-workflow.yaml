    The IPI XPN workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that 
    provision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster into a shared VPC 
    on GCP with BYO hosted zone, allowing job authors to inject their own 
    end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-xpn-minimal-permission-byo-hosted-zone-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow 
    without a need to backport changes.
