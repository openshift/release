  documentation: "The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that \nprovision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster with confidential-computing  \non GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-confidential-computing-provision` and \n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to \nallow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without \na need to backport changes."
