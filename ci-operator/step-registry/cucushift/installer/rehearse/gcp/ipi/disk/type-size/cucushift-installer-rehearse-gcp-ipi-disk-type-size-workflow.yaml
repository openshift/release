    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps 
    that provision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a 
    default configuration on GCP, allowing job authors to inject 
    their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `{provision,deprovision}` chains to allow other workflows to mimic 
    and extend this base workflow without a need to backport changes.
