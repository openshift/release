    The IPI workflow provisions and deprovisions an OpenShift cluster on GCP 
    with Shielded VMs (secure boot) & Confidential VMs (data is encrypted 
    while it is being processed), allowing job authors to inject their own 
    end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-secureboot-confidential-computing-provision` and 
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to 
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
