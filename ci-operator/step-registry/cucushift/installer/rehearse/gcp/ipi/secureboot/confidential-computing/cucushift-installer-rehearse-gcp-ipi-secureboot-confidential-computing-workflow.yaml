  documentation: "The IPI workflow provisions and deprovisions an OpenShift cluster on GCP \nwith Shielded VMs (secure boot) & Confidential VMs (data is encrypted \nwhile it is being processed), allowing job authors to inject their own \nend-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-secureboot-confidential-computing-provision` and \n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to \nallow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without \na need to backport changes."
