    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that 
    provision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster with GCP static IAM
    service accounts, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end 
    test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-cco-manual-static-creds-provision` 
    and `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to allow 
    other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without a need 
    to backport changes.
