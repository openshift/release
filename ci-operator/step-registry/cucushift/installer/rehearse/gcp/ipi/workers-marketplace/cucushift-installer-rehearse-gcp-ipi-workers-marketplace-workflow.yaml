  documentation: |-
    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that 
    provision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster with GCP marketplace 
    image, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-workers-marketplace-provision` and 
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-deprovision` chains to 
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
