    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift disconnected cluster (behind proxy) with a default
    configurationon GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-proxy-cco-manual-workload-identity-filestore-csi-{provision,deprovision}`
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without
    a need to backport changes.
