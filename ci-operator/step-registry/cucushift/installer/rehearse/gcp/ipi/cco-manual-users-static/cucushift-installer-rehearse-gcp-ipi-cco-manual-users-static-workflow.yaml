    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and 
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with GCP static IAM service accounts, allowing 
    job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-ipi-cco-manual-users-static-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without a need 
    to backport changes.
