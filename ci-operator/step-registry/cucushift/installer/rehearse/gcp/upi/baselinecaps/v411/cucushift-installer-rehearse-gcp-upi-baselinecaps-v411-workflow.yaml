    The UPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a default configuration
    on GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-upi-{provision,deprovision}` chains to
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without
    a need to backport changes.
