    The UPI XPN workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift private cluster with a default configuration 
    on GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-upi-private-xpn-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
