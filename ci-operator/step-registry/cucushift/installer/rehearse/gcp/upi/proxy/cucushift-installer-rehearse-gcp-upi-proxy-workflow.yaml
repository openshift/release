  documentation: "The UPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and\ndeprovision an OpenShift disconnected cluster (behind proxy) with a default \nconfiguration on GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.\n\nAll modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the\n`cucushift-installer-rehearse-gcp-upi-proxy-{provision,deprovision}` \nchains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without \na need to backport changes."
