    Run negative validation tests for AWS gp3 root volume throughput boundary validation.
    These tests verify that invalid throughput values are properly rejected during
    'create manifests' phase without requiring actual cluster installation.
    No cluster provisioning or deprovisioning is needed as these are configuration validation tests.
