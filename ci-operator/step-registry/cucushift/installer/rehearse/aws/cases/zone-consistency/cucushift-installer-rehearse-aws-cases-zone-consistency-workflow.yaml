    This workflow runs static validation tests for OCPBUGS-69923: Control plane machine
    zone allocation consistency. It verifies that CAPI and MAPI manifests have consistent
    zone allocation for control plane machines. No cluster provisioning or deprovisioning
    is needed as these are configuration validation tests only.
