    Run static validation tests for OCPBUGS-69923: Control plane machine zone allocation
    consistency. This generates manifests using openshift-install and verifies that CAPI
    and MAPI manifests have consistent zone allocation. No cluster provisioning or
    deprovisioning is needed as these are configuration validation tests only.
