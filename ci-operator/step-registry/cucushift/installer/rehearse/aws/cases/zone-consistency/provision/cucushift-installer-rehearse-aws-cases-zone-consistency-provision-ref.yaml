    Verify control plane machine zone allocation consistency in manifests (OCPBUGS-69923).
    This step generates manifests using openshift-install and verifies that CAPI and MAPI
    manifests have consistent zone allocation for control plane machines.
    This is a static validation test that does not require actual cluster installation.
