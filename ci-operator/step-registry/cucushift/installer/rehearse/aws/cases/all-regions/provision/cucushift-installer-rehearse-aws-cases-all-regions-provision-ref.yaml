    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The instance type to use for control plane nodes (e.g. AWS https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). 
      When "" (default), the controlPlane.platform.aws.type will be empty.
  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_TYPE

  - name: OCP_ARCH
    default: "amd64"

      The architecture of the control plane nodes (e.g., amd64, arm64).
  - name: CUSTOM_REGION_LIST
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      If specified, only regions in this list will be tested, e.g. CUSTOM_REGION_LIST: "us-east-1 us-east-2"
      REGIONS_IGNORED and SPILT_REGIONS will be ignored if CUSTOM_REGION_LIST is not empty.
  - name: REGIONS_IGNORED
    default: "ap-northeast-1 us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-2"
    documentation: |-
      Regions in this list will not be tested.
      Some regions will not be tested in this test, e.g. us-east-1 is already covered in daily test.
      It works only if CUSTOM_REGION_LIST is empty.
  - name: SPILT_REGIONS
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Currently there are more than 30 regions to be tested, it's really a long run test.
      This parm can split regions into 2 parts, and pick one part to test.

      Allowed values:
      "": Default, all regions will be tested
      "REGION_SET_A": Top half of `aws ec2 describe-regions | jq -r '.Regions[].RegionName' | sort`
      "REGION_SET_B": Bottom half of `aws ec2 describe-regions | jq -r '.Regions[].RegionName' | sort`
      It works only if CUSTOM_REGION_LIST is empty.
  - name: SPOT_INSTANCES
    default: "true"
    documentation:  "Use AWS Spot Instances for *worker* nodes.  Set to 'true' to opt into spot instances.  Explicitly set to 'false' to opt out.  Leave unset for the default, which may change."
  - name: SPOT_MASTERS
    default: "true"
    documentation:  "Use AWS Spot Instances for *master* nodes. Set to 'true' to opt into spot instances. Explicitly set to 'false' to opt out. Leave unset for the default, which may change. Note that spot masters are only supported when installing with a) CAPI; or b) newer installer versions (see https://github.com/openshift/installer/pull/8349). A preflight check will fail if this variable is set to 'true' for an unsupported configuration."
