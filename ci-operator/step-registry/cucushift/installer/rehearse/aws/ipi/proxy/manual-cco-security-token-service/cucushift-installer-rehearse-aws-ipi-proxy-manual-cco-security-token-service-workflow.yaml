    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with AWS security token service, allowing job authors 
    to inject their own end-to-end test logic.
    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-aws-ipi-proxy-manual-cco-security-token-service-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
