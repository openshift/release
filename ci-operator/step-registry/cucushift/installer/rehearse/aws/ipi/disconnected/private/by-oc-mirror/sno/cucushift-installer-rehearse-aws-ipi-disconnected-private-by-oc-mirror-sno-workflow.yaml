    This is a demo workflow for install rehearse/test by oc-mirror only.
    The workflow shows how to provision/deprovision a private AWS SNO cluster in a disconnected network.
    Users who want to run e2e test against this cluster, can re-use provision/deprovision chains in their own e2e test workflow.
