    The IPI workflow provides chains that provision and deprovision
    a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster with a default configuration 
    on GCP, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-aws-ipi-sno-provision` and 
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-aws-ipi-deprovision` chains to 
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
