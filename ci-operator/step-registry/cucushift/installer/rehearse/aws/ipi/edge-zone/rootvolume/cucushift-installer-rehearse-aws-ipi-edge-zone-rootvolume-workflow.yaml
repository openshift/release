    This is the workflow to trigger Prow's rehearsal test for AWS root volume
    configuration tests with edge zones. It uses phase 2 workflow where edge zone subnets are
    automatically provisioned by the installer (if edge zone is enabled). It includes
    root volume configuration and post-installation verification in the pre phase.
    Supports both default machine pool settings and individual settings for
    compute/control plane/edge nodes.
