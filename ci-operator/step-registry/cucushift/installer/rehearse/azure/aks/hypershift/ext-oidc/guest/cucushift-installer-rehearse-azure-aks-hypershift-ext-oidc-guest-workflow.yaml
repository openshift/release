  documentation: "This workflow creates and later destroys an aks management cluster and a public hosted cluster \nusing external OIDC. oc commands in the tests will target the guest cluster. \nNote that it is impossible to run cucushift test cases against such a hosted cluster as it only has one (external) user."
