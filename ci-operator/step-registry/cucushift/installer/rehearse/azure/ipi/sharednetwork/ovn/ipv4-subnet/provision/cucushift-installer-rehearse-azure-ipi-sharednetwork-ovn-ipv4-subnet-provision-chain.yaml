    documentation: |-
      internalJoinSubnet is a v4 subnet used internally by ovn-kubernetes in case the
      default one is being already used by something else. It must not overlap with
      any other subnet being used by OpenShift or by the node network. The size of the
      subnet must be larger than the number of nodes. The value cannot be changed
      after installation.
      The current default value is 100.64.0.0/16
      The subnet must be large enough to accommodate one IP per node in your cluster
      The value must be in proper IPV4 CIDR format
