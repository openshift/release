    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster which workers are market-place image with a default configuration 
    on AZURE, allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-azure-ipi-marketimage-{provision,deprovision}` chains to 
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
    This only supports in 4.11 and later version.
