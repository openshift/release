    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift disconnected & private cluster with AZURE workload identity, 
    allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.
    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-azure-ipi-disconnected-cco-manual-workload-identity-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
