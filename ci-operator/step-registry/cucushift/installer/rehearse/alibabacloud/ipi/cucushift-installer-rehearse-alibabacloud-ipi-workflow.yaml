    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that 
    provision and deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a default 
    configuration on Alibabacloud, allowing job authors to inject their 
    own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-alibabacloud-ipi-{provision,deprovision}` 
    chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow 
    without a need to backport changes.
