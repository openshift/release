    The IPI workflow provides provision- and deprovision- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift Cluster with dedicated host on IBMCloud, the dedicated 
    host created by cluster automatically, allowing job authors to inject their own 
    end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `cucushift-installer-rehearse-ibmcloud-ipi-dedicatedhost-dynamic-{provision,deprovision}` chains to 
    allow other workflows to mimic and extend this base workflow without 
    a need to backport changes.
