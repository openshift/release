    Verify control plane machine zone allocation consistency in manifests (OCPBUGS-69923).
    This step verifies that CAPI and MAPI manifests have consistent zone allocation
    for control plane machines after manifests are generated.
    This should run after 'create manifests' but before 'create cluster'.
