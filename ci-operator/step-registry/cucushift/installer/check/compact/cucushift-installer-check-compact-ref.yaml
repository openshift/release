  - name: CONTROL_PLANE_REPLICAS
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of control plane nodes to create for the cluster.

      This variable should only be supplied in consultation with the etcd team. The
      etcd operator has to explicitly support the specified number of control plane
      nodes and values not documented below will result in unhealthy and/or
      unsupportable clusters.

      Valid values include:
      * "" (default) - 3 control plane nodes. The standard for stand-alone clusters.
      * "1" - Supportable for single-node OpenShift (SNO).
      * "5" - Supportable only for select customers.
  - name: SIZE_VARIANT
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers
      * "large" - 16 vCPU, 64GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 250 nodes
      * "xlarge" - 32 vCPU, 128GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 1000 nodes

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.
      Do not change the default family type without consulting with cloud financial operations as their may
      be active savings plans targeting this machine class.
  documentation: >-
    The step checks if it's a compact (3-node) OpenShift cluster.
