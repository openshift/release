      The type of config for the environment to deploy. 
      * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on our tests, 
        which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't require a proxy server to be deployed. 
      * 'byon' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created network (BYON) so it wouln't require the usage of floating IPs. 
        This config type will require a proxy server to be deployed. 
      * 'proxy' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created restricted network (BYON) and a Cluster Proxy.
