    This workflow creates and later destroy a public Hypershift hosted cluster on AWS using external OIDC. 
    oc commands issued during the tests will be executed as an external user and will target the hosted cluster.
    Note that it is impossible to run Cucushift test cases against such a hosted cluster 
    as it can only have one (external) user.
