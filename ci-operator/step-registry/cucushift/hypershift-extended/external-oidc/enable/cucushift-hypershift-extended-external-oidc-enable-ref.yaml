      If true, include the CLI OIDC client along with the console client in 
      hc.spec.configuration.authentication.oidcProviders[0].oidcClients.
      Note that the CLI component is synced to authentication/cluster.status.oidcClients[?(@.componentName=="cli")]
      within the hosted cluster by the CLIOIDCClientStatus controller in the console operator. This controller was
      introduced in OpenShift 4.16 (https://issues.redhat.com//browse/CONSOLE-3902).
      Set this environment variable to false only for OpenShift 4.15.

    This step patches the rendered Hypershift artifacts (`${SHARED_DIR}/hypershift_create_cluster_render.yaml`) 
    to enable external OIDC, then applies them without waiting for the hosted cluster to be ready and healthy.
