    This step retrieves the VPC ID and a public subnet ID from the first hosted cluster from the management cluster.
    Files named ${SHARED_DIR}/vpc_id and ${SHARED_DIR}/public_subnet_ids are created to store these IDs, respectively. 
    It is expected that these files do not exist prior to this step.
