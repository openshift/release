    Creates the files necessary to deploy a vSphere agent based installation (ABI).
    It uses install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml to generate the ISO, .openshift_install_state.json,
    and kubeconfig files with the modifications required to support the vSphere ABI workflow.
    These files are copied to the shared directory for future consumption.
