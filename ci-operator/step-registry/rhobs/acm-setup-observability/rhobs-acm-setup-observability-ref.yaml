    It deploys the ACM MultiClusterObservability component.
    It assumes the acm-install chain has completed successfully.
    It performs the following actions:
    1. Creates the 'open-cluster-management-observability' namespace.
    2. Deploys MinIO as an S3-compatible object store.
    3. Creates the 'MultiClusterObservability' Custom Resource.
    4. Waits for all key components to become ready.
