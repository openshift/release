    documentation: |-
      Since Pre GA catalogs are not very stable, if this variable is 'yes',
      the job is still not able to create the Pre GA catalog, as the version
      may have already reached GA status and the packages needed for installation
      may be available in the official catalogs.
      If, on the other hand, you want to ensure that the catalog has been created
      for the current job, set it to 'no' explicitly.
