    This step allows to verify the SNO Spoke cluster deployed through its kubeconfig.
    OCP version is loaded from SHARED_DIR/ocp_version.txt (set by deploy step).
    If a graceful quit is requested by a higher version job, this test will be skipped
    to release the baremetal host lock faster. The oslat test will have already completed
    by this point, so PTP reporting can still collect those results.
