      This ENV var will be the symbolic link that points to the folder that contains all relevant Hub cluster files
      so that it can be known from another later job during Spoke deployment.
      You will be able to consume the content of that folder from a later job, by ssh-ing or rsyncing from the
      shared file located at AUX_HOST host
