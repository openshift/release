      InstallConfigOverrides allows to pass install config parameters to be added as
      annotation in the AgentClusterInstall CR. The values provided at InstallConfigOverrides
      must be in json format code in base64. For example: "{\"controlPlane\":{\"hyperthreading\":\"Disabled\"}}".
      This will transform installConfigOverrides and networkType as annotation for AgentClusterInstall as below:

    This step allows to generate and push the SiteConfig CR needed to deploy a ZTP SNO Spoke cluster.

    It performs the following tasks:
    1. Extracts RHCOS images and cluster configuration
    2. Generates and deploys the AgentServiceConfig CR with mirror registry configuration
    3. Generates ZTP cluster manifests (SiteConfig, ClusterInstance, etc.)
    4. Pushes SiteConfig to Git repository for GitOps deployment

    When pull-secret-with-pre-ga.json is present, it configures mirror registries for Konflux/dev builds
    in the AgentServiceConfig, allowing the Assisted Installer to pull images from quay.io/acm-d and
    brew.registry.redhat.io instead of registry.redhat.io.
