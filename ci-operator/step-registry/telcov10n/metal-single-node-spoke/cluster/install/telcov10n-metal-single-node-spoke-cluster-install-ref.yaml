  env:
  - name: SITE_CONFIG_VERSION
    default: "v2"
    documentation: |-
      The SiteConfig API version to be used. Note that the Hub cluster only
      support 'v1' (deprecated) or 'v2' (default) for all deployments.
  - name: SHARED_HUB_CLUSTER_PROFILE
    default: "ztp-hub-preserved-prod-cluster_profile_dir"
    documentation: |-
      This ENV var will be the symbolic link that points to the folder that contains all relevant Hub cluster files
      so that it can be known from another later job during Spoke deployment.
      You will be able to consume the content of that folder from a later job, by ssh-ing or rsyncing from the
      shared file located at AUX_HOST host
  - name: AUX_HOST
    default: ""
    documentation: |
      The Bastion host where jobs can share synchronised data and run remote aux scripts and playbooks
  - name: SOCKS5_PROXY
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      If cluster endpoints are reachables through a socks5 proxy
  - name: REFRESH_TIME
    default: "3m"
    documentation: |-
      The rate at which the cluster installation progress logs are displayed.
  - name: ABORT_INSTALLATION_TIMEOUT
    default: "1 hours + 45 min"
    documentation: |-
      Set the amount of time, the step must wait at most, before unconditionally forcing the workflow to continue
      with the next steps which will clean up and free all resources used in the deployment of this cluster
      (MIN: "REFRESH_TIME value", default: "1 hours + 45 min", MAX: "2 hours - REFRESH_TIME value").
  - name: QUIT_CHECK_INTERVAL
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      Number of REFRESH_TIME iterations between each quit condition check. A higher priority job (newer OCP version)
      waiting for the baremetal host lock can request the current job to quit. This setting controls how often
      the installation loop checks for such quit requests. Uses "force" mode (exit 1) since an interrupted
      installation leaves the cluster unusable. Default is 3 (check every 3 iterations, i.e., every 9 min
      with default REFRESH_TIME of 3m).
  - name: BIOS_SETTINGS
    default: "{}"
    documentation: |-
      For the BIOS attributes to be passed in to the HostFirmwareSettings CR during the ZTP SNO Spoke cluster deployment.
      In Yaml format. '{}' means current BIOS attributes are ok.
  documentation: |-
    This step allows to setup the artifacts need to deploy a SNO Spoke cluster
