      The storage class name for the storage class to be used by the virtualization. Historically, ceph rbd was used.
      However, some tests may require different storage classes. For example, clusters including arm64 nodes for virtualization
      cannot use ceph rbd storage classes at the time of writing for lack of arm64 support in ceph rbd. In such cases, on AWS,
      gp3-csi or efs storage classes can be used.
      If empty, the related fields will not be set in the test.
