    Installs a Hypershift cluster with a default configuration and installs an
    optional operator using the built index image that refers to build bundle
    images. Currently only supported on AWS due to usage of the introspection credentials from
    CLUSTER_PROFILE_DIR so that tests relying on the AWS APIs still succeed. It also uses the ipi-install-rbac step to expose the Bundle Images
    similarly to IPI for usage in a Hypershift Cluster
