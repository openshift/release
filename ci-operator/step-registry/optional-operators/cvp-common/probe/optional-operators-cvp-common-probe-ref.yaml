    This steps serves as an frequently-executed probe that verifies OpenShift CI
    generally works and certain externally observed behavior does not change. The
    probe will attempt to access bundle and index images (testing that OpenShift CI
    can access internal images via authenticated proxy) and then save values of
    all parameters to a well-known artifact (so it can be verified that parameter
    passing works and artifact placement did not change).
