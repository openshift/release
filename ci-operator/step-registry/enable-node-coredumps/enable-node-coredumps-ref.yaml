    The coredump service configures nodes to save all generated coredumps. This is useful for debugging failures of
    components running in privileged pods, such as router pods.
    The service is deployed by injecting an installer manifest containing a MachineConfig. This contains one systemd
    unit, which sets the sysctl variable fs.suid_dumpable to 1, instructing systemd-coredump to save any coredumps it
    encounters into /var/lib/systemd/coredump/ . Those coredump files can then be collected using the gather-core-dump
    chain.
