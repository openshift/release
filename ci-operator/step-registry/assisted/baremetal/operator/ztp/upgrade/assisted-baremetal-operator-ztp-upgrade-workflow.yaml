    Using hub-cluster with Assisted Service operator to deploy extra workers as spoke clusters.
    Installation will be following ZTP flow (Zero Touch Provisioning), meaning no explicit
    provisioning actions will be made outside of the system. First, AI operator with version ocm-2.3 
    is installed and a spoke SNO cluster is deployed. The subscription is updated to upgrade the AI
    operator from ocm-2.3 to the latest version to upgrade the AI operator. Once the operator is upgraded,
    a new spoke SNO cluster is installed.
