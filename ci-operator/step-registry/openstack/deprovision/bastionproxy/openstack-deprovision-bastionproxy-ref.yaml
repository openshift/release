        The type of config for the environment to deploy.

        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'proxy' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created restricted network (BYON) and
                   a Cluster Proxy.

    This step deletes the bastion proxy.
