  - name: OPENSTACK_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD
    default: "version-default"
    documentation: |-
      Determines what credentials are used to authenticate against OpenStack.
      Can be "password", "application-credentials", or "version-default".
      The "version-default" is equivalent to "password" for OCP versions below 4.13,
      and "application-credentials" otherwise.
      Application credentials are created on the fly and set to expire after a
      time interval set with APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRATION.
  - name: APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRATION
    default: "8 hours"
    documentation: |-
      When to set the expiration of the application credentials. Use a format
      that `date -d` would understand. This variable only has effect if
      OPENSTACK_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD is set to "application-credentials".
  - name: ROTATE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      If this variable is not empty, prepare two different sets of credentials
      to access the cluster, so that they can be rotated post-install and prior
      to running the tests. This variable only has effect if
      OPENSTACK_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD is set to "application-credentials".
  - name: OS_CLOUD
    default: "openstack"
    documentation: Name of cloud to use from the clouds.yaml file
  - name: CLUSTER_TYPE_OVERRIDE
    default: ''
    documentation: |-
      If set, overrides CLUSTER_TYPE in this step.
  - name: CONFIG_TYPE
    default: ''
    documentation: |
      The type of config for the environment to deploy.

      * 'dualstack' - Configure the install-config to enable dualstack clusters.
      * 'singlestackv6' - Configure the install-config to enable single-stack v6 clusters.
  - name: CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_V6
    default: ''
    documentation: |-
      Name of the OpenStack ipv6 subnet in the control plane network. Defaults to the value in
      "${SHARED_DIR}/CONTROL_PLANE_SUBNET_V6"
  documentation: |-
    openstack-conf-clouds exposes a clouds.yaml for the requested CLUSTER_TYPE
    in SHARED_DIR. If they are available, this step also copies to SHARED_DIR
    the `cacert` file and the proxy credentials.
