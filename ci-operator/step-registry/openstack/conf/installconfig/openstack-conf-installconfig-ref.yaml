        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'proxy' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created restricted network (BYON) and
                   a Cluster Proxy.

    Generates install-config.yaml based on the requested CONFIG_TYPE.
    Saves the file as ${SHARED_DIR}/install-config.yaml. Load balancer IP and cluster
    name are expected to be in ${SHARED}/API_IP and ${SHARED_DIR}/CLUSTER_NAME
    respectively.
    This ref is compatible with OCP 4.6+ and will break 4.5, because `ingressFloatingIP` was only introduced in 4.6.
