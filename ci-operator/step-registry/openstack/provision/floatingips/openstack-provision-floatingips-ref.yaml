        The type of config for the environment to deploy.

        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'proxy' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created restricted network (BYON) and
                   a Cluster Proxy.

        Name of the OpenStack public-facing network. Defaults to the value in
        "${SHARED_DIR}/OPENSTACK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK"

    set to "${SHARED_DIR/CLUSTER_NAME".api-fip and
    "${SHARED_DIR/CLUSTER_NAME".ingress-fip. Writes IP and UID of created FIPs to
    $SHARED_DIR for later reference.
