        The type of config for the environment to deploy.

        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'byon' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created network (BYON) so it wouln't
                   require the usage of floating IPs. This config type will require a proxy server
                   to be deployed.

    This step creates the necessary resources for user-provided custom subnet
    when $CONFIG_TYPE is byon.
    It creates a network named "${CLUSTER_NAME}-network".
    Then it adds to it a subnet named "${CLUSTER_NAME}-subnet"
    and creates a router named "${CLUSTER_NAME}-router".
    It attaches the router to the subnet of the $OPENSTACK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK.
    Finally, it writes their UIDS to ${SHARED_DIR}.
