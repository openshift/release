        The type of config for the environment to deploy.

        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'byon' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created network (BYON) so it wouln't
                   require the usage of floating IPs. This config type will require a proxy server
                   to be deployed.
  documentation: |-
    This step creates the bastion proxy when $CONFIG_TYPE is byon.
