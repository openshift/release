    This step deploys MinIO as a lightweight S3-compatible object storage
    solution. It creates the MinIO deployment, service, and required buckets
    (ros-data, insights-upload-perma, koku-bucket).
    
    This is a lightweight alternative to ODF for tests that only need
    S3-compatible object storage without block or file storage.
