    Tests OpenShift Dedicated from the SRE perspective where it verifies
    the cluster with the SREP operators running on it. These operators are
    what makes it a managed OpenShift cluster. OSDE2E is used to provision
    the cluster, verify the cluster health checks have succeeded, run SREP
    operator tests, collect cluster logs and delete the cluster provisioned
    using available steps within the step registry.
