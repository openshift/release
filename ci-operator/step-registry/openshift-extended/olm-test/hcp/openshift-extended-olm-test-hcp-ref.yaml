      The type of test to perform.

      * 'suite' - Run the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE. By default this executes the OpenShift parallel conformance suite.
      * 'suite-conformance' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product conformance
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional.
      * 'upgrade' - Perform an upgrade to the image defined by OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE.

    The OLM E2E HCP test step executes openshift-tests for HCP (Hosted Control Plane)
    clusters like ROSA HCP. This step is specifically designed to skip machine/node count
    validation checks that are not applicable to HCP environments where control plane nodes
    are managed externally.

    This step is optimized for ROSA HCP and AWS-based HCP clusters, supporting OLM testing
    without the traditional Machine API dependency checks.
