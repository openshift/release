    This workflow performs shared pre/post actions on clusters obtained from
    preinstalled pools (https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#testing-with-a-cluster-from-a-cluster-pool).
    The intent of this workflow is to prepare the test environment of rhtap via rhtap-cli and register pac server to Sprayproxy.
