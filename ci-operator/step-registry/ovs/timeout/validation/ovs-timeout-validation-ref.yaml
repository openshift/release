    This step validates the OVS timeout fix for OCPBUGS-66075 in HyperShift HCP environments.
    
    The step:
    1. Creates 1000 concurrent pods to stress test OVS timeout handling
    2. Monitors for OVS timeout errors (should be zero with 90s timeout fix)
    3. Validates that ≥85% of pods successfully reach Running state
    4. Uses custom release image containing the OVS timeout fix
    
    This validates that the OVS timeout increase from 30s to 90s prevents
    pod creation failures during high concurrent workloads in HCP clusters.
