  env:
  - name: BUILD_WITH_CONTAINER
    default: "0"
    documentation: |-
      Set the environment variable BUILD_WITH_CONTAINER to use a container to build the repo and run the tests inside a container
  - name: VERSIONS_YAML_FILE
    default: "versions.ossm.yaml"
    documentation: |-
      The name of the versions.yaml file to use. versions.ossm.yaml contains supported versions for productized sail operator (ossm)
  - name: EXPECTED_REGISTRY
    default: "^registry.redhat.io"
    documentation: |-
      Which registry should be expected in tests for checking correct images.
  - name: SKIP_BUILD
    default: "true"
    documentation: |-
      If set to true, the test will skip the build process and an existing operator image will be used to deploy the operator and run the test. (productized sail operator is already in the cluster before tests in lpiterop pipeline)
  - name: SKIP_DEPLOY
    default: "true"
    documentation: |-
      If set to true, the test will skip the deployment of the operator. This is useful when the operator is already deployed in the cluster, and you want to run the test only. (productized sail operator is already in the cluster before tests in lpiterop pipeline)
  - name: OPERATOR_NAMESPACE
    default: "openshift-operators"
    documentation: |-
      The namespace where the operator is (skip_deploy=true) or will be deployed (skip_deploy=false) and the test will run.
  - name: DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    default: "servicemesh-operator3"
    documentation: |-
      The name of the operator deployment.
  - name: GINKGO_FLAGS
    default: "-v --keep-going"
  - name: VERBOSE
    default: "true"
  documentation: |-
    Executes sail operator e2e tests (with default values against product operator (ossm operator)). Ensure that your pipeline has `maistra-builder` as the build root, since `from: src` is used here and the script expects the sail repository to be in the root directory.
