# E2E Limited Preview Interoperability Test Script
#
# This script runs end-to-end interoperability tests for the Sail Operator
# in Limited Preview mode on OpenShift clusters.
#
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Sets up the Kubernetes environment and switches to the default project.
# 2. Configures the operator namespace from the OPERATOR_NAMESPACE variable
#    (used instead of NAMESPACE to avoid conflicts with global environment).
# 3. Executes the e2e.ocp test suite using the configured test environment.
# 4. Collects test artifacts and saves them as JUnit XML reports.
# 5. Preserves the original exit code from the test execution for proper
#    CI failure reporting, even if artifact collection succeeds.
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - SHARED_DIR: Directory containing the kubeconfig file.
#   - OPERATOR_NAMESPACE: The namespace where the operator is installed.
#   - ARTIFACT_DIR: The local directory to store test artifacts.
#
# Notes:
#   - Uses OPERATOR_NAMESPACE instead of NAMESPACE to avoid conflicts with
#     global pipeline variables used during the post phase.
#   - JUnit report files must start with 'junit' prefix for CI recognition.
