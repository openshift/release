    Creates a cost-effective OpenShift Single Node Cluster (SNC) using MAPT (Multi Architecture Provisioning Tool) for OSSM Istio testing.
    The cluster provides better OpenShift compatibility compared to vanilla Kubernetes while maintaining cost efficiency with spot instances.

    This step dynamically creates a unique S3 bucket for Pulumi state storage, eliminating the need for pre-existing shared buckets.
    The bucket name is saved to ${SHARED_DIR}/mapt-s3-bucket-name for cleanup by the destroy step.

    The step provides kubeconfig at ${SHARED_DIR}/kubeconfig for subsequent test execution steps.
    Uses AWS credentials from the existing vault system (cluster-secrets-ossm-aws) and pull secret for OpenShift cluster access.

    Resource defaults: 8 CPU / 32GB RAM with spot instances for 70-90% cost savings compared to on-demand instances.
