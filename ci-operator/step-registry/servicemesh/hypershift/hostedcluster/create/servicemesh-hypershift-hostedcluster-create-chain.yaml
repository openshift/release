    OSSM-specific version of hypershift-hostedcluster-create chain that uses
    ossm-aws-quota-slice for dedicated resource allocation.

    This chain provides the same functionality as the original hypershift-hostedcluster-create
    but uses OSSM's dedicated quota pool (150 slots across 3 AWS regions) instead of
    the generic hypershift quota pool (30 slots), ensuring better resource availability
    for OSSM workloads.
