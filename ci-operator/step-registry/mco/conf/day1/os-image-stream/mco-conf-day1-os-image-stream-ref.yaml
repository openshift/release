        Space-separated list containing the names of the MachineConfigPools
        that will be created with the osImageStream configuration.
        Only 'master' and 'worker' are allowed for day-1 configuration.
        Custom pools should be configured using the day-2 step after cluster installation.
        If the value is empty, no MachineConfigPool manifests will be created and this step will be skipped.
        Example: "master worker"
    - name: MCO_CONF_DAY1_OS_IMAGE_STREAM_NAME
      default: ""
      documentation: |
        Name of the osImageStream to configure on the created MCPs.
        This must reference a valid stream name that will be available in the OSImageStream cluster resource.
        The name must be a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, dots).
        If the value is empty, no MachineConfigPool manifests will be created and this step will be skipped.
        Example: "rhel-10"
  documentation: |-
    This step creates MachineConfigPool manifest files in the manifests directory
    with the osImageStream field configured. The manifests are created in the SHARED_DIR
    with the 'manifest_' prefix and will be included during cluster installation.
    This is a day-1 configuration that should be run before 'openshift-install create cluster'.
    Requires the OSStreams feature gate to be enabled.
