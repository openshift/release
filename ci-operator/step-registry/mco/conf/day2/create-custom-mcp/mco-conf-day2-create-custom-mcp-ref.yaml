    - name: MCO_CONF_DAY2_CUSTOM_MCP_FROM_LABEL
      default: "node-role.kubernetes.io/worker"
      documentation: |
        The label used to filter the nodes that can be added to the new pool. 
        By default we take any node fomr the worker pool, but we can narrow it by adding more lables
        For example, "node-role.kubernetes.io/worker,beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64" will take only worker nodes with arch=amd64
        We should always specify the worker role, to make sure that we don't try to add a master node

    Creates a new custom MachineConfigPool and add nodes to this new pool
