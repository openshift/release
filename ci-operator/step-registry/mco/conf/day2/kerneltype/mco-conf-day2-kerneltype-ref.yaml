        Space-separated list containing the names of the MachineConfigPools
        where the kerneltype will be installed

      default: ""
      documentation: |
        Name of the kerneltype that will be installed. Allowed values ['realtime', '64k-pages']
        * 'realtime' - Install real time kernel
        * '64k-pages' - Install huge pages kernel
        If the value is empty, no MachineConfig will be created and this step will be skipped
    - name: MCO_CONF_DAY2_INSTALL_KERNEL_TIMEOUT
      default: "20m"
      documentation: |
        Maximum time that we will wait for a single pool to be updated with the new kernel.
        The default 20m value is valid for pools with 2 or 3 workers.
        If we need to install the kernel in pools with more workers or in master pool we should increase its value.
  documentation: |-
    This step creates new MachineConfig resources in order to install a new kerneltype in the 
    given MachineConfigPools and waits for the configuration to be applied
