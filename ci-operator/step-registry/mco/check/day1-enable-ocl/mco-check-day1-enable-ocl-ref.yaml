    Verifies that the day1 OCL (OS layering) deployment was successful by checking that the
    pre-built custom osImage appears in the machine-config-daemon-firstboot.service logs on all
    nodes in the configured MachineConfigPools. Also verifies that the image does NOT appear in
    nodes where OCL was not deployed. Creates a junit test result file with the verification results.
