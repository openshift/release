  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift aws e2e cluster optional operators workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision a new ephemeral HyperShift cluster.
    In addition, it uses the optional-operators-operator-sdk step for an optional operator installation.
    In order to install the operator on the hosted-cluster, one should the `USE_HOSTED_KUBECONFIG = true`
    under the step test.
    Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    The HyperShift launch capability is currently supported by the HyperShift
    team. For now, please direct all questions and comments to:
