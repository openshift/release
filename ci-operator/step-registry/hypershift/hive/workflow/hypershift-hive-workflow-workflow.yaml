  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift hive workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    Note that tests will execute once the control plane is ready, regardless of
    whether nodes have been requested, have joined, or are available.

    The control plane is hosted on hive cluster.

    OpenShift versions supported by this workflow are 4.12.x.
    OpenShift 4.13.x are not supported and will cause hypershift-aws-create to stall

  steps:
    pre:
    - ref: openshift-cluster-bot-rbac
    - chain: hypershift-hive-create
    post:
    - chain: hypershift-hive-destroy
