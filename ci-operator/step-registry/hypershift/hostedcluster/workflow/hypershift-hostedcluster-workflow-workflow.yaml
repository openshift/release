  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift hive workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    Note that tests will execute once the control plane is ready, regardless of
    whether nodes have been requested, have joined, or are available.

    This workflow uses a shared HyperShift management cluster run by the Test Platform team.

    OpenShift versions supported by this workflow are 4.12.x.
    OpenShift 4.13.x are not supported and will cause hypershift-aws-create to stall

  steps:
    pre:
    - ref: openshift-cluster-bot-rbac
    - chain: hypershift-hostedcluster-create
    post:
    - chain: hypershift-hostedcluster-destroy
