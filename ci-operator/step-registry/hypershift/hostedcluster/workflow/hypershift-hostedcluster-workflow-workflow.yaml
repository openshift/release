  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift hive workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    Note that tests will execute once the control plane is ready, regardless of
    whether nodes have been requested, have joined, or are available.

    This workflow uses a shared HyperShift management cluster run by the Test Platform team.

    OpenShift versions supported by this workflow are 4.n, 4.n-1, and 4.n-2, where n is the
    version of Openshift in the hypershift-cli:latest image.
