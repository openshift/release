  as: hypershift-openstack-conformance
  documentation: |-
    Sets up all the mgmt/infra cluster prerequisites necessary for hypershift openstack guest clusters.
    Then runs openshift e2e tests.
    This workflow can be use for regular conformance tests or CSI, you'll need to set
    TEST_SUITE and also TEST_CSI_DRIVER_MANIFEST if testing CSI.
