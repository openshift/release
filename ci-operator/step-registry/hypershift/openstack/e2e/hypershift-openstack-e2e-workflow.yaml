workflow:
  as: hypershift-openstack-e2e
  documentation: |-
    This workflow is a fork from `hypershift-aws-e2e-nested-workflow`.
    First of all, it'll deploy a management cluster on aws-nested and then
    it will runs preparation steps that are needed to deploy Hypershift
    using the OpenStack platform: prepare clouds.yaml, provision a floating IP
    for Ingress and create a DNS record for it.
    The test stanza will execute a step that runs the e2e tests which itself
    takes care of creating the HostedCluster, run tests and destroy the HostedCluster
    once finished.
    Finally, in post we clean the DNS record and floating IP created in pre.
  steps:
    env:
      API_FIP_ENABLED: false
      AWS_PROFILE: ""
      BASE_DOMAIN: origin-ci-int-aws.dev.rhcloud.com
      CONFIG_TYPE: minimal
