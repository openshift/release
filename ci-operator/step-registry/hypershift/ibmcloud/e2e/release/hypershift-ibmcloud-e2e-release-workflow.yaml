    The HyperShift IBM Cloud e2e workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. The HyperShift installation mirrors how HyperShift is
    consumed and configured for the IBM Cloud use case, and verifies all required
    expectactions for operating HyperShift-based solutions on IBM Cloud.

    The control plane is hosted on managed IKS and ROKS clusters on IBM Cloud and
    is destroyed after tests complete.
