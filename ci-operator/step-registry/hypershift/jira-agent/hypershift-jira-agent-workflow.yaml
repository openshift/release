    HyperShift Jira Agent workflow for automated issue processing.

    This workflow:
    1. Setup: Verifies Claude Code CLI is available
    2. Process: Queries Jira for labeled issues, runs /jira-solve for each, creates PRs

    The workflow uses the /jira-solve command in non-interactive mode.
    Issues are queried from Jira with: project in (OCPBUGS, CNTRLPLANE) AND status in (New, "To Do") AND labels = issue-for-agent
