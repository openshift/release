    Process step for the HyperShift dependabot triage periodic job.
    This step:
    - Generates GitHub App tokens for fork and upstream access
    - Clones HyperShift from the fork and adds upstream remote
    - Queries GitHub for open dependabot PRs in openshift/hypershift
    - Invokes Claude with all PR numbers and consolidation instructions
    - Claude processes each PR with validation before moving to next
    - Creates a single consolidated PR with all dependency updates
    - Uses best-effort: processes as many PRs as possible, reports failures
    - Uses Vertex AI for Claude authentication via GCP service account
