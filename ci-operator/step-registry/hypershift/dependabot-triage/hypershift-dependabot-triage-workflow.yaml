    Periodic workflow that triages dependabot PRs in the HyperShift repository.

    This workflow:
    1. Setup: Clones HyperShift repo from fork, configures git credentials, sets up Claude CLI
    2. Process: Queries open dependabot PRs, invokes Claude to process and consolidate into single PR
    3. Report: Generates HTML report with token usage, cost estimates, and processing details

    The workflow uses the /fix-hypershift-repo-robot-pr command from HyperShift in non-interactive mode.
    All dependabot PRs are consolidated into a single PR with organized commits.

    Schedule: Weekly on Fridays at 12:00 UTC (7:00 AM ET)
