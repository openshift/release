  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift Azure e2e self-managed workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster running on self-managed Azure infrastructure. This workflow provisions
    an Azure management cluster using HyperShift on a shared management plane, installs the
    HyperShift operator, and runs e2e tests.

    Administrative access to the control plane is provided via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    The HyperShift launch capability is currently supported by the HyperShift
    team. For now, please direct all questions and comments to:
