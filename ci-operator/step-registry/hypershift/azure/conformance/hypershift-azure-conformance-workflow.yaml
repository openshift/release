  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift azure conformance workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    Note that tests will execute once the control plane is ready, regardless of
    whether nodes have been requested, have joined, or are available.

    The control plane is hosted on a dedicated standalone OCP cluster running
    HyperShift in the `osd-hypershift` AWS account and is destroyed after tests
    complete.

    The HyperShift launch capability is currently supported by the HyperShift
    team. For now, please direct all questions and comments to:
