  as: hypershift-mce-power-conformance
  documentation: |-
    The hypershift-mce-power-conformance workflow runs tests on a newly created ephemeral HyperShift Agent cluster.
    For standard workflows: Tests execute on Power nodes to ensure the cluster reaches a completed state.
    For heterogeneous setups: Tests run across a combination of Power and x86 nodes to validate cluster creation.
