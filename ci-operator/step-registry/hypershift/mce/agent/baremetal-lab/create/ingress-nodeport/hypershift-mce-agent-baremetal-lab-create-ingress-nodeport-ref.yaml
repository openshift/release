    This step to setup a node port service for the ingress of the hypershift hosted cluster. This means that the 
    hosted cluster must be backed by an external load balancer that can route traffic to the node port service.
    For example, see the load-balancer spawn by the baremetal-lab-hypershift-hosted-pre-load-balancer chain.
