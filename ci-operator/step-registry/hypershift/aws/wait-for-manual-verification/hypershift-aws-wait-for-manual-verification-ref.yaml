    This step pauses the CI workflow to allow manual verification of NodePool API Schema.
    It displays helpful commands for inspecting NodePools and waits for a configurable
    duration before proceeding with automated tests.

    Use this step to:
    - Verify NodePool API schema fields (e.g., imageType from CNTRLPLANE-408)
    - Inspect NodePool configurations before running tests
    - Debug NodePool creation issues

    Set WAIT_DURATION environment variable to control how long to wait (in seconds).
    Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
