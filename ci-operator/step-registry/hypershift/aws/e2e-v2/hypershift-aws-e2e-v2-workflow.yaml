  documentation: |-
    The HyperShift aws e2e-v2 workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    The control plane is hosted on a dedicated standalone OCP cluster running
    HyperShift in the `osd-hypershift` AWS account and is destroyed after tests
    complete.

    The HyperShift launch capability is currently supported by the HyperShift
    team. For now, please direct all questions and comments to:

    - Alberto Lamela (agarcial@redhat.com)
    - Seth Jennings (sjenning@redhat.com)
    - Cesar Wong (cewong@redhat.com)
