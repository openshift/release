    The HyperShift aws e2e workflow executes tests against a new ephemeral
    HyperShift cluster. Administrative access to the control plane is provided
    via the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

    The HyperShift launch capability is currently supported by the HyperShift
    team. For now, please direct all questions and comments to:
