    HyperShift Review Agent workflow for automated PR review comment handling.

    This workflow:
    1. Setup: Verifies Claude Code CLI is available and configures git credentials
    2. Process: Queries GitHub for agent-created PRs with pending reviews, runs /utils:address-reviews for each

    The workflow uses the /utils:address-reviews command from ai-helpers in non-interactive mode.
    PRs are identified by being created from the hypershift-community fork with Claude Code attribution.
