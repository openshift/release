        This is used by the RDU2 reservation script to specify the architecture of any additional nodes that should be
        reserved but not deployed as part of the cluster. In the hypershift case, the additional workers are deployed as
        node pools in this step.

    Note: this is expected to work in the lab-based clusters only, as deployed by the baremetal/ steps.
