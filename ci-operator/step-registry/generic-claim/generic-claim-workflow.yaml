    This workflows perform shared pre/post actions on clusters obtained from
    preinstalled pools (https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#testing-with-a-cluster-from-a-cluster-pool).
    The intent of this workflow is to mimic the `ipi-$PLATFORM` workflow behavior,
    just without the installation/deprovision steps.
