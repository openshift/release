    The pre-deprovision artifacts step collects console logs from AWS instances.  It gathers console logs for all nodes and machines with a provider ID, as well as any instance IDs listed in ${SHARED_DIR}/aws-instance-ids.txt.  aws-instance-ids.txt entries should have a single provider ID per line.  Duplicate entries are ok; the step deduplicates before gathering.
