    This workflow installs an OSD cluster with the specified configurations using the provided openshift version.
    The cluster is set with htpasswd idp, and the login information is stored under $SHARED_DIR/api.login.
    It then installs the required addons and operators on the cluster.
    Eventually, the cluster will be de-provisioned and test reports will be posted in the target Jira tickets.
