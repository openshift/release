    Updates ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) configuration for a hypershift guest cluster by patching
    the HostedCluster resource with imageContentSources. Verifies that the IDMS is properly
    propagated to the guest cluster and checks that the registries.conf file is updated on
    guest cluster nodes. If verification fails, it will delete and recreate nodes to force
    IDMS propagation.
