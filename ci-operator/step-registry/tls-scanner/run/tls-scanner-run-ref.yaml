    PLACEHOLDER: This is a temporary placeholder for the tls-scanner-run step.
    The actual implementation is being added in https://github.com/openshift/release/pull/71526.

    This step will scan all open ports on the cluster and validate they are using
    the configured PQC-compliant cipher suites. It will fail if any non-compliant
    ports are found.
