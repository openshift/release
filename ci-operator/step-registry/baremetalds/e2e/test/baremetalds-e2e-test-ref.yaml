      The type of test to perform.
      * 'suite' - Run the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE. By default this executes the
                  OpenShift parallel conformance suite. All product components must run the
                  default suite on pull requests prior to merge.
      * 'suite-conformance' - Runs the test suite defined by TEST_SUITE, then runs the product conformance
                  suite to verify the cluster is still functional. This is typically used for testing
                  disruption from one suite, then confirming that the disruption did not degrade the
                  product.
      * 'upgrade' - Perform an upgrade to the image defined by OPENSHIFT_UPGRADE_RELEASE_IMAGE_OVERRIDE.
                  The TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS flag may be optionally set. All product components
                  must run the default upgrade test (verify an upgrade completes) on pull requests
                  prior to merge.
      * 'upgrade-conformance' - Performs the 'upgrade' test and then executes the full conformance
                  suite after upgrade completes. Does not honor TEST_SUITE but will respect
                  TEST_UPGRADE_OPTIONS. All product releases must pass the conformance suite after
                  an upgrade completes or have explicit logic in their test to tolerate behavior after
                  upgrade.
