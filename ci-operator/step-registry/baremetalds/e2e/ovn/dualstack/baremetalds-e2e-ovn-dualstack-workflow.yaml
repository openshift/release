    This workflow executes the common end-to-end test suite on a cluster provisioned by running dev-scripts
    on a packet server with both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled. The pre chain is not using any specific ovn workflow
    because by default devscripts uses OVNKubernetes for NetworkType if the IP_STACK has any v6.
