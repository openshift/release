  - name: NO_OVERLAY_OUTBOUND_SNAT
    default: "Enabled"
    documentation: |-
      Controls outbound SNAT for NoOverlay mode. Valid values: "Enabled" or "Disabled".
      When "Enabled", pod traffic to external networks is SNATed to node IPs.
      When "Disabled", pod traffic uses original source IPs (requires proper routing).
  - name: NO_OVERLAY_ROUTING
    default: "Unmanaged"
    documentation: |-
      Controls routing mode for NoOverlay. Valid values: "Unmanaged" or "Managed".
      "Unmanaged" - User/admin manages routes outside of OVN.
      "Managed" - OVN manages routes automatically.
  documentation: |-
    This step sets up FRR route reflector container on the packet server and creates
    network operator manifests with FRR provider, NoOverlay transport, and configurable
    routing that will be applied during cluster installation
