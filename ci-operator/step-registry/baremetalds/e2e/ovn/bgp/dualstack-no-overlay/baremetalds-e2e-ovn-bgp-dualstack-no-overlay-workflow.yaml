    This workflow executes the common end-to-end test suite on a cluster provisioned by running dev-scripts
    on a packet server with both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled with the cluster configured with NoOverlay network transport,
    Unmanaged routing, FRR provider, and BGP in shared gateway mode.
    This workflow differs from baremetalds-e2e-ovn-bgp-dualstack by creating a NoOverlay network operator
    manifest before cluster installation, and from baremetalds-e2e-ovn-bgp-dualstack-local-gw-no-overlay
    by using shared gateway mode instead of local gateway mode (without extra network and nmstate operator).
