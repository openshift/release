  documentation: |-
    Cleans up the test VM created on the remote baremetal hypervisor during the
    baremetalds-e2e-ovn-ote-pre step. This step ensures proper cleanup of resources
    after OVN-Kubernetes OTE end-to-end tests complete. Uses kcli in a nested container
    to delete the VM and associated resources.
