    documentation: |
      The pytest expression to filter "tests" according to. In our case pytest
      is used as a generic runner for our installation flows. The default
      `test_bootstrap_in_place` expression is used to do a regular, single-node
      bootstrap-in-place installation on a libvirt VM. It can also be set, for
      example, to `test_bip_add_worker` if you wish to run a slightly different
      flow in which a worker node is also added to that BIP SNO after
      installation.
