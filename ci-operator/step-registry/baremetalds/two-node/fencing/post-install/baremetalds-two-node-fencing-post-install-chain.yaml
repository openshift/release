    The node degradation step runs a shell script to degrade a node in the cluster, preparing the environment for fencing scenarios.
    The image registry setup step runs a shell script that waits for the image registry to become available, patches it to use emptyDir storage,
    and waits for the registry deployment to become ready, ensuring the image registry is functional after node degradation.
