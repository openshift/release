        The type of config for the environment to deploy.

        * 'minimal' - Configure the install-config with the minimal options to make it work on
                      our tests, which requires the usage of floating IPs. This config type doesn't
                      require a proxy server to be deployed.
        * 'proxy' - Configure the install-config to use a pre-created restricted network (BYON) and
                   a Cluster Proxy.

    Deploy a load-balancer that can be used as a user-managed LB for the
    OpenShift control-plane.
    To use this step, a few things are required.

    * A bastion node has to be deployed beforehand. Its IP address has to be
      in $SHARED_DIR/LB_HOST and the name of the user used to SSH into it
      has to be in $SHARED_DIR/LB_USER.
    * SSH server has to be enabled on the bastion and the user has to have sudo access. Also, the SSH port
      has to be reachable from OpenShift CI systems.
    * If your bastion does not have the VIPs created for API and ingress, they can be created by Ansible.
      For that you'll need to put them (respectively) in $SHARED_DIR/API_IP and $SHARED_DIR/INGRESS_IP.
      Otherwise, if you deal with them yourself (e.g. by running Keepalived), then you can ignore these
      two files.
    * Master and worker nodes IPs (if they're known, otherwise the whole subnet can be used) have to be respectively in the
      multi-line $SHARED_DIR/MASTER_IPS and $SHARED_DIR/WORKER_IPS files.
