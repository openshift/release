    The tcpdump-service step deploys a tcpdump systemd service to collect packet headers to any IP on port 443.
    It is useful for debugging network issues that cannot be reproduced live.
    The service is deployed by injecting an installer manifest containing a MachineConfig. This in turn contains
    a script and two systemd units, one to install tcpdump, and another to run the tcpdump service script.
    tcpdump.pcap will be present in /tmp/tcpdump.pcap.
