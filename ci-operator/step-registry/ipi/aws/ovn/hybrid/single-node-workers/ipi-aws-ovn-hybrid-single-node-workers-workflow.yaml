    A minimal OpenShift cluster with one (1) control-plane node and three (3)
    worker nodes by default configured with Hybrid OVN network. The number of
    worker nodes can be configured by setting the SNO_WORKER_COUNT environment
    variable. This workflow is especially useful for testing a Windows nodes,
    where a minimal cluster is needed.
