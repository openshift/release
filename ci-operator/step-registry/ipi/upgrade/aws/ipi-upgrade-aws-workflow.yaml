    The IPI upgrade workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a default configuration on AWS,
    allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    The original installation will use the initial release payload and upgrade
    to the latest release payload, however the configuration defines those.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `ipi-aws-{pre,post}` chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend
    this base workflow without a need to backport changes.
