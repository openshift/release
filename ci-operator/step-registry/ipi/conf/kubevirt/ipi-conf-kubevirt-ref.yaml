    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to depoloy to the KUBEVIRT project.
    An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in the shared directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the KUBEVIRT project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
