  - name: SIZE_VARIANT
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers
      * "large" - 16 vCPU, 64GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 250 nodes
      * "xlarge" - 32 vCPU, 128GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 1000 nodes

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.

  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_TYPE
    default: 'Standard_D4s_v3'
    documentation: |-
      The instance type to use for compute nodes
  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_REPLICAS
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of compute/worker nodes to create for the cluster.
      If SIZE_VARIANT is set to "compact", this is ignored and no workers are created.
      (default: 3)
  - name: OCP_ARCH
    default: "amd64"
    documentation: |-
      The architecture of the control plane nodes (e.g., amd64, arm64).
  - name: BASE_DOMAIN
    default: ci.azure.devcluster.openshift.com
    documentation: |-
      This value represents the the DNS zone that is configured in the azure portal, and it will be used in the base_domain field
      of the install-config.yaml file.
  - name: OUTBOUND_TYPE
    default:  ""
    documentation: |-
      This value represents the routing strategy used to connect the cluster to the internet
  - name: USER_TAGS
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Add '${KEY} ${VALUE}\n' lines to declare additional user tags for the cluster.  For example 'keyA valueA\nkeyB valueB\n', but with actual newlines.
  dependencies:
  - name: "release:latest"
    env: RELEASE_IMAGE_LATEST_FROM_BUILD_FARM
  documentation: |-
    The IPI Azure configure step generates the Azure-specific install-config.yaml contents based on the cluster profile and optional input files.
