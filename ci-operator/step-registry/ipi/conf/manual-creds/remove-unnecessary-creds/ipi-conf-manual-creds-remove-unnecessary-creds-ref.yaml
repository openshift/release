    Starting from 4.12, some operators are optional, e.g. Storage
    But the its CR is still exctracted by oc command, and ccoctl/user will create related credentials according to the exctracted CRs.
    For those operators are not installed, but some CRs are related to them (e.g. Storage), we need to remove them, otherwise it will cause bootstrap fail:
      e.g.
      failed to create secrets.v1./ebs-cloud-credentials -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers: namespaces "openshift-cluster-csi-drivers" not found
