    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to deploy to the LIBVIRT project.
    An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in the ${SHARED_DIR} directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the LIBVIRT project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
