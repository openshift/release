    The ipi-conf-openstack-securitygroups chain is identical to the ipi-conf-openstack
    except that it configures worker nodes with an additional security group rules. It contains all the
    refs and chains necessary to configure the system before deploying an IPI
    installation of OpenShift onto OpenStack.
