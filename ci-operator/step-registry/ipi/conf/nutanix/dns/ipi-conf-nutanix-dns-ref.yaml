    Uses nutanix context data in ${SHARED_DIR}/nutanix_context.sh to create
    route53 dns records. Outputs ${SHARED_DIR}/basedomain.txt to ensure
    consistent basedomain in conf and deprovision steps. Saves batch job
    to delete DNS records to ${SHARED_DIR}/dns-delete.json for use in
    deprovisioning, with the hosted zone ID in ${SHARED_DIR}/hosted-zone.txt.
