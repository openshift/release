    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to depoloy to the Nutanix
    CI project. An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in 
    the shared directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the Nutanix CI
    project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
