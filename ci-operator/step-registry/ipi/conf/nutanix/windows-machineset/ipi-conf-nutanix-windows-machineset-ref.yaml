    This IPI step adds a new machineSet to provision Windows instances in nutanix and depends on a secret with name 
    `windows-user-data` in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. The `windows-user-data` secret is created 
    automatically by the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), therefore the operator must be deployed and
    running for this step to succeed.
