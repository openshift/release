    Apply CustomNoUpgrade feature gate configuration to cluster to enable
    custom feature flags. CUSTOM_FEATURE_FLAGS_ENABLED and
    CUSTOM_FEATURE_FLAGS_DISABLED are comma-separated lists of feature flags to
    enable or disable respectively. If both CUSTOM_FEATURE_FLAGS_ENABLED and
    CUSTOM_FEATURE_FLAGS_DISABLED are empty this step will safely have no
    effect, and the CustomNoUpgrade feature gate will not be enabled.
