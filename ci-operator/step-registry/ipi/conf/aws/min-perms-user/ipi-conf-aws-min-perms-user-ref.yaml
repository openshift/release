        "no", default option, if the install should be done with the standard user from the cluster profile.
        "yes" if the step should create a new user and attach a policy with only the install-needed permissions.
  documentation: |-
    Generate a custom user with minimal install permissions. This has to run as the last step in the conf chain,
    since the cluster configuration affects the permissions required.
