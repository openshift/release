    documentation: |-
      Specify the pool ID if a specific pool should be used. Otherwise, the step will default to 
      a pool available in the account & region. Specify "none" to disable the use of a custom
      pool. Custom pools allow the use of IPv4 addresses purchased by Red Hat to defray the 
      cost of using AWS' public pool: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html .
      Use of custom pools is only supported in OCP versions >= 4.16.
