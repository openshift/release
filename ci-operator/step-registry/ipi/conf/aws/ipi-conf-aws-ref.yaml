  - name: SIZE_VARIANT
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers
      * "large" - 16 vCPU, 64GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 250 nodes
      * "xlarge" - 32 vCPU, 128GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 1000 nodes

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.

  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_TYPE
    default: "m5.xlarge"
    documentation: |-
      The instance type to use for compute nodes (e.g. AWS https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). We use a 4 core worker to match the median configuration of the fleet.
  - name: OCP_ARCH
    default: "amd64"
    documentation: |-
      The architecture of the control plane nodes (e.g., amd64, arm64).

  - name: ZONES_COUNT
    default: "2"
    documentation: |-
      The number of Availability Zones to present in the cluster. This depends on the selected region.
  - name: BASE_DOMAIN
    default: "origin-ci-int-aws.dev.rhcloud.com"
    documentation: |-
      A fully-qualified domain or subdomain name. The base domain of the cloud provider is used for setting baseDomain variable of the install configuration of the cluster.
  documentation: |-
    The IPI AWS configure step generates the AWS-specific install-config.yaml contents based on the cluster profile and optional input files.
