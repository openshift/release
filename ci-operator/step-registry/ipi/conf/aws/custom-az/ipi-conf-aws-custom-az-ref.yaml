    documentation: |-
      The number of Availability Zones to present in the cluster. This depends on the selected region.
      Ignored when AVAILABILITY_ZONES is set.
  - name: AVAILABILITY_ZONES
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Comma-separated list of availability zones to use (e.g. "us-west-2a,us-west-2b,us-west-2c").
      May include zones from multiple regions; only zones matching the current region are selected.
      When set, ZONES_COUNT is ignored.
  documentation: |-
    Generate configuration for Availability Zones prior to running ipi-conf-aws, this allows us to set zones in order (a,b,c) rather then getting random AZ's.
    Alternatively, accepts a custom list of availability zones via AVAILABILITY_ZONES.
