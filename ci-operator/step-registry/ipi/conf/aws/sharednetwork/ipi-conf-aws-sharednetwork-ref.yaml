    The IPI AWS configure step generates the AWS-specific install-config.yaml contents based on the cluster profile and optional input files.
  env:
  - name: ZONES_COUNT
    default: "2"
    documentation: |-
      The number of Availability Zones to present in the cluster. Accepted values are 1, 2, and 3.
  - name: AWS_EDGE_POOL_ENABLED
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      Flag to enable the AWS Edge compute pool. This flag is AWS-specific when deploying nodes in Local Zone using the 'edge' compute
      pool option in install-config.yaml, or when the subnets in Local Zones have been provided.
      Setting the value to "yes" in the workflow, it will create the the CloudFormation stack and save the name to be used
      in the deprovision step.
      The CloudFormation stack creates the subnet in AWS Local Zone when installing a cluster in existing VPC (also created in the same step,
      using different stack).
