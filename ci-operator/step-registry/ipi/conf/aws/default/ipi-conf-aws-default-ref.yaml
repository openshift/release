    documentation: |-
      The number of compute/worker nodes to create for the cluster.
      If SIZE_VARIANT is set to "compact", this is ignored and no workers are created.

  - name: CONTROL_PLANE_REPLICAS
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of control plane nodes to create for the cluster. Useful for SNO cluster provision.
  - name: OCP_ARCH

    In most cases, ipi-conf-aws and other ipi-conf-aws* steps/chains are used to create configuration for AWS clusters.
    But due to various reasons, some non-default options are always configured, e.g. AZ, instance type.
    In some cases, we need a minmal configuration with all default options. e..g. minimal permission tests.
    This setp will create deafult install-config for AWS cluster.
