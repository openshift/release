  - name: CONTROL_PLANE_REPLICAS
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of control plane nodes to create for the cluster.

      This variable should only be supplied in consultation with the etcd team. The
      etcd operator has to explicitly support the specified number of control plane
      nodes and values not documented below will result in unhealthy and/or
      unsupportable clusters.

      Valid values include:
      * "" (default) - 3 control plane nodes. The standard for stand-alone clusters.
      * "1" - Supportable for single-node OpenShift (SNO).
      * "5" - Supportable only for select customers.

  - name: SIZE_VARIANT
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers
      * "large" - 16 vCPU, 64GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 250 nodes
      * "xlarge" - 32 vCPU, 128GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 1000 nodes

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.

  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_TYPE
    default: "bx2-4x16"
    documentation: |-
      The instance type to use for compute nodes (e.g. IBM Cloud VPC
      https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes#vm-table).
      We use a 8 core worker to match the median configuration of the fleet.
  - name: ZONES_COUNT
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of AZ's to present in the cluster. Accepted values are 1 to 3.
  - name: BASE_DOMAIN
    default: "ci-ibmcloud.devcluster.openshift.com"
    documentation: |-
      A fully-qualified domain or subdomain name. The base domain of the cloud
      provider is used for setting baseDomain variable of the install
      configuration of the cluster.
  - name: RESOURCE_GROUP
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The resource group where the resources are installed in support of the installation.
  - name: WORKERS
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The number of workers created during installation.
  documentation: >-
    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to depoloy to the IBM
    Cloud CI project.
    An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in the shared
    directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the IBM Cloud CI
    project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
