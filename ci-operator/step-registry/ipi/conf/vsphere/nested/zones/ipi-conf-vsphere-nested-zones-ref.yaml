    documentation: |-
      Number of datacenters to provision. Presently, 1 is the only supported value. Datacenters will be named as:
      nested-ci-datacenter-[0..NESTED_DATACENTERS] where NESTED_DATACENTERS is exclusive. For example, 1 will result 
      in creating nested-ci-datacenter-0.

    documentation: |-
      Number of clusters per datacenter to create. Presently, 1 is the only supported value. Cluster will be named as:
      nested-ci-datacenter-[dc number]-cluster-[0..NESTED_CLUSTERS] where NESTED_CLUSTERS is exclusive. For example, 1 will result 
      in creating nested-ci-datacenter-[dc number]-cluster-0.
