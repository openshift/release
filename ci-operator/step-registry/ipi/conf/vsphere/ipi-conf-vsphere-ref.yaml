      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.
