    Using secrets from the vSphere cluster profile, the vSphere VIP setup step
    reserves IP addresses through IPAM and saves them to $SHARED_DIR/vips.txt
    for later use in creating DNS records and the install config. They are also
    needed in deprovisioning to release the reserved VIPs (via the
    ipi-deprovision-vsphere-vips step).
