    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to depoloy to the GCP CI project.
    An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in the shared directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the GCP CI project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
