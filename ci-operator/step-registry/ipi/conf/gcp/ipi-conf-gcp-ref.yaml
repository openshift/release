  - name: CONTROL_PLANE_REPLICAS
    default: "3"
    documentation: |-
      The number of control plane nodes to create for the cluster.

      This variable should only be supplied in consultation with the etcd team. The
      etcd operator has to explicitly support the specified number of control plane
      nodes and values not documented below will result in unhealthy and/or
      unsupportable clusters.

      Valid values include:
      * "" (default) - 3 control plane nodes. The standard for stand-alone clusters.
      * "1" - Supportable for single-node OpenShift (SNO).
      * "5" - Supportable only for select customers.

  - name: SIZE_VARIANT
    default: ""
    documentation: |-
      The size of the cluster in one of our supported t-shirt values that is standard across all CI environments.

      The sizes are:
      * "" (default) - 4 vCPU, 16GB control plane nodes, default workers
      * "compact" - 8 vCPU, 32GB control plane nodes, no workers
      * "large" - 16 vCPU, 64GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 250 nodes
      * "xlarge" - 32 vCPU, 128GB+ control plane nodes, default workers, suitable for clusters up to 1000 nodes

      These sizes are roughly consistent across all cloud providers, but we may not be able to instantiate some sizes
      in some regions or accounts due to quota issues.

  - name: COMPUTE_NODE_TYPE
    default: "n1-standard-4"
    documentation: |-
      The instance type to use for compute nodes (e.g. GCP https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types). We use a 4 core worker to match the median configuration of the fleet.
  - name: RT_ENABLED
    default: "false"
    documentation: |-
      This flag forces the installation of real-time kernel to worker nodes.
  documentation: >-
    This step configures an install-config.yaml file to depoloy to the GCP CI project.
    An existing install-config.yaml file should already exist in the shared directory.
    The file is modified to configure the cluster to run in the GCP CI project.
    The resulting file remains in the shared directory for future consumption.
