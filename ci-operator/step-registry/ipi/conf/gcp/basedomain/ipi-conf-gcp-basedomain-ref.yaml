  documentation: >-
    The IPI configuration step updates baseDomain in install-config.yaml. 
    If BASE_DOMAIN is given a non-empty value explictly, the value will 
    be used as the baseDomain. Otherwise, with about 50% possibility, a 
    random value will be used, which means there's no corresponding dns 
    public zone.
