    The IPI workflow provides pre- and post- steps that provision and
    deprovision an OpenShift cluster with a default configuration on Kubevirt,
    allowing job authors to inject their own end-to-end test logic.

    All modifications to this workflow should be done by modifying the
    `ipi-kubevirt-{pre,post}` chains to allow other workflows to mimic and extend
    this base workflow without a need to backport changes.
