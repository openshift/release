    documentation: |-
      Flag to enable the AWS Edge compute pool. This flag is AWS-specific when deploying nodes in Local Zone using the 'edge' compute
      pool option in install-config.yaml, or when the subnets in Local Zones have been provided.
      Setting the value to "yes" in the workflow, it will lookup for the CloudFormation stack name created
      in the provision step to delete it.
