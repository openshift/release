    The ipi-openstack-pre-disconnected chain contains the necessary refs
    and chains to run ipi install on OpenStack in disconnected environment.
    Because we need RBAC to be configured before populating the mirror,
    we can't re-use the `ipi-install` chain and had to add the refs from there.
