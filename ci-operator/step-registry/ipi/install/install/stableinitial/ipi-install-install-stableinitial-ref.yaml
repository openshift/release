    The IPI install step runs the OpenShift Installer from stable-initial imagestream in order to bring up an OpenShift cluster, using the provided cluster profile to choose a target IaaS platform. Anything that needs to be configured using manifests should generate them before this step and put them in the SHARED_DIR with the filename manifest_(manifest_name).yml so that this step can pull in the manifest in.
