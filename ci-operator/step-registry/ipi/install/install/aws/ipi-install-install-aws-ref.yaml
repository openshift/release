    The IPI install step runs the OpenShift Installer in order to bring up an OpenShift cluster,
    using the provided cluster profile to choose a target IaaS platform.
    Anything that needs to be configured using manifests should generate them before this step and put them in the SHARED_DIR
    so that this step can pull in the manifests. Files with name manifest_(manifest_name).yml|yaml end up in $INSTALL_DIR/manifests,
    while files with name tls_(tls_asset_name).key|pub end up in $INSTALL_DIR/tls.
    this step allows to create apps dns manually by setting ADD_INGRESS_RECORDS_MANUALLY.
    Note: errexit and pipefail are not set, this is intentional, this allows you to do additional actions even the `create cluster` process failed.
