    The IPI install step runs the OpenShift Installer in order to bring up an OpenShift cluster, using the provided cluster profile to choose a target IaaS platform. Anything that needs to be configured using manifests should generate them before this step and put them in the SHARED_DIR so that this step can pull in the manifests. Files with name manifest_(manifest_name).yml|yaml end up in $INSTALL_DIR/manifests, while files with name tls_(tls_asset_name).key|pub end up in $INSTALL_DIR/tls.
