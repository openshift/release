    The IPI install step runs the OpenShift Installer in order to bring up an OpenShift cluster, using the kubevirt provided.
    This step was duplicated from ipi-install-install-ref.yaml because of the changes in calling the binary openshift-install,
    that needs the KUBECONFIG of the infra cluster, in order to create a tenant cluster.
