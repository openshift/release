    This step creates a Key Vault in the "${SHARED_DIR}/resourcegroup".
    It grants the appropriate permissions on the newly created Key Vault to the Service Principal
    corresponding to the current cluster profile without using RBAC.
    Next, it creates a key in the Key Vault.
    Finally, the URL of the created key is written to ${SHARED_DIR}/azure_active_key_url.
