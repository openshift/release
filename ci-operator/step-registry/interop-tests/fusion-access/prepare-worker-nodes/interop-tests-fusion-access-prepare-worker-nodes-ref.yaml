    Prepare worker nodes for IBM Storage Scale deployment on Red Hat CoreOS.
    
    This step creates required directories on worker nodes that IBM Storage Scale
    kernel module build process (mmbuildgpl) expects to exist. While IBM's 
    documentation (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative/5.2.3) confirms
    that mmbuildgpl builds kernel modules on OpenShift, these directory prerequisites
    are not explicitly documented because standard Linux systems have them by default.
    Red Hat CoreOS's minimal, immutable filesystem requires explicit creation.
    
    Required directories created on each worker node:
    - /var/lib/firmware - Required by mmbuildgpl for kernel module compilation
    - /var/mmfs/etc - IBM Storage Scale configuration directory
    - /var/mmfs/tmp/traces - IBM Storage Scale trace/log directory
    - /var/mmfs/pmcollector - IBM Storage Scale performance monitoring directory
    
    Without these directories, deployment fails with multiple symptoms:
    - mmbuildgpl init container enters CrashLoopBackOff
    - Error: "rsync: change_dir /host/var/lib/firmware failed: No such file or directory"
    - SSH key secrets never created (operator can't progress)
    - Filesystem stuck in "ongoing" status indefinitely
    - Pods fail with: "MountVolume.NewMounter initialization failed: 
      path '/var/mmfs/pmcollector' does not exist"
    
    Evidence from rehearsal runs (before this step existed):
    - October 1st builds showed mmbuildgpl CrashLoopBackOff on all daemon pods
    - After adding this step (October 6th+), all tests passed successfully
    
    IBM Storage Scale worker node requirements:
    - CPU: 2000mCPU minimum (configured via STORAGE_SCALE_*_CPU)
    - Memory: 4 GiB (client) / 8 GiB (storage) (configured via STORAGE_SCALE_*_MEMORY)
    - Storage: ~25 GiB in /var directory
    - Reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/scalecontainernative/5.2.2?topic=planning-hardware-requirements
    
    This step must run after:
    - Worker nodes are ready and labeled
    
    This step must run before:
    - IBM Storage Scale Cluster creation
