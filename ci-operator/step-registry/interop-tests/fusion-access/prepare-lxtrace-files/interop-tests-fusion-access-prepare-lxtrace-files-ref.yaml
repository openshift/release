    Create lxtrace dummy files on worker nodes for IBM Storage Scale compatibility.
    
    The buildgpl script (created by IBM Storage Scale operator when KMM is not fully
    supported) expects lxtrace files in /var/lib/firmware directory. These files are
    used for trace logging in IBM Storage Scale.
    
    This step creates dummy lxtrace files to satisfy the buildgpl script's rsync
    requirement and prevent "No such file or directory" errors.
    
    Workaround for: IBM Storage Scale v5.2.3.1 manifests on RHCOS
    - v5.2.3.1 doesn't fully support KMM on RHCOS
    - Falls back to buildgpl script which expects these files
    
    Future: This step can be removed when using IBM Storage Scale versions
    with proper KMM support that use Driver Toolkit instead of buildgpl.
