    EBS integration chain for IBM Fusion Access testing with EBS filesystem.
    
    This chain provides the EBS-specific components for IBM Fusion Access testing:
    - EBS volume creation: Creates and attaches 3x100GB gp3 EBS volumes per worker node
    - LocalDisk creation: Creates LocalDisk resources (for Filesystem references)
    - Filesystem creation: Creates IBM Storage Scale filesystem using LocalDisk references
    
    Note: Cluster uses /dev/disk/by-id/* device pattern for automatic discovery of
    EBS volumes. KMM registry must be configured for kernel module building (since
    IBM Fusion Access v0.0.19+).
        
    This chain should be used after the shared deployment chain to complete
    the EBS-based IBM Fusion Access deployment.
    
    Prerequisites:
    - Shared deployment chain must complete successfully
    - IBM Storage Scale cluster must be ready
    - AWS cluster with worker nodes (using EBS volumes for storage)
