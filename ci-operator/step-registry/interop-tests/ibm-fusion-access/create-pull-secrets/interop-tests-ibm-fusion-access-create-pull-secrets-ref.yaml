    Create Fusion Access pull secrets for IBM entitlement key and additional registry access.
    This step creates the necessary Kubernetes secrets for accessing IBM and other required container registries.
    These secrets are used by other steps in the test chain.
    
    This step handles IBM entitlement credentials gracefully:
    - Checks standard credential location at /var/run/secrets/ibm-entitlement-key
    - Continues execution even without credentials
    - Provides clear messaging about credential status
