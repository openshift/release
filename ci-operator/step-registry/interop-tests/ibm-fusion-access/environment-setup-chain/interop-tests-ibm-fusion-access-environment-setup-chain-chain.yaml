    Fusion Access environment setup chain that provides the core deployment
    infrastructure for Fusion Access Operator testing.
    
    This chain sets up the complete Fusion Access environment including:
    - Cluster health verification
    - Fusion Access core deployment:
      - Namespace creation for Fusion Access and IBM Storage Scale
      - Pull secret creation for IBM registry access
      - AWS security group configuration for IBM Storage Scale networking
      - Fusion Access Operator installation with proper credentials
      - FusionAccess custom resource creation
      - KMM registry configuration (dual-namespace: ibm-fusion-access + ibm-spectrum-scale-operator)
      - CRD validation and node readiness checks
      - Worker node labeling for storage components
      - Worker node preparation (creating required directories)
      - lxtrace file preparation (RHCOS compatibility workaround)
      - IBM Storage Scale cluster creation (without hardcoded device paths)
      - buildgpl ConfigMap patching (fixes v5.2.3.1 compatibility issues)
    
    After this chain completes, the environment is ready for storage-specific
    testing chains (EBS integration or CNV shared storage).
    
    Note: The Cluster uses /dev/disk/by-id/* device pattern to discover all
    attached devices automatically, avoiding instance-type-specific naming issues.
    
    RHCOS Compatibility: Steps include workarounds for IBM Storage Scale v5.2.3.1
    manifests which have limited KMM support and fall back to buildgpl script with
    bugs. These workarounds can be removed when using newer versions with proper
    KMM/Driver Toolkit support.
    
    Prerequisites:
    - OpenShift cluster with sufficient worker nodes (minimum 3)
    - AWS cluster with proper security group configuration
    - IBM entitlement credentials (for production runs, optional for rehearsal)
    
    This chain provides a clean separation between environment setup and
    storage-specific testing, allowing for better test organization and
    reusability across different storage backends.
