      The provisioned IOPS for the io2 volume (minimum 100, maximum 64000).
  documentation: |-
    Creates a single io2 EBS volume with multi-attach enabled and attaches
    it to all worker nodes in the cluster.
    
    This provides shared block storage suitable for IBM Storage Scale Container
    Native deployments that require a shared LUN accessible from all nodes.
    
    Requirements:
    - All target nodes must be in the same availability zone
    - io2 volume type supports multi-attach
    - Volume is tagged for automatic cleanup with cluster deletion
    
    The volume ID is saved to SHARED_DIR/multiattach-volume-id for reference.
