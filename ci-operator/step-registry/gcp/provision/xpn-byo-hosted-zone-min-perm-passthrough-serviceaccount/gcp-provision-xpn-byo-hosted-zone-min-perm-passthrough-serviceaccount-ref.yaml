    The step enables the IAM service account which is for minimum 
    permissions testing of deploying OCP cluster into shared VPC on GCP. 
    In particular, this service account doesn't have permissions 
    creating/deleting/etc. firewall-rules and/or binding a private zone to 
    the shared VPC in the host project, so plase Bring-Your-Own Hosted Zone 
    before the installation.
