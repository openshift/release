# About periodic-build-origin-release-image-origin-release* Jobs

Each job in [infra-periodics-origin-release-images.yaml](infra-periodics-origin-release-images.yaml) trigger a buildConfig which
generates an image in the repo `registry.ci.openshift.org/ci/origin-release`.
Then the images are imported to `registry.ci.openshift.org/openshift/release` by [clusters/app.ci/supplemental-ci-images/origin-stable/release.yaml](../../clusters/app.ci/supplemental-ci-images/origin-stable/release.yaml).

The jobs are generated by [hack/generate-periodic-build-origin-release-image-jobs.sh](../../hack/generate-periodic-build-origin-release-image-jobs.sh)
according to the [buildConfigs](../../clusters/build-clusters/01_cluster/ci/_origin-release-build) on the cluster `build01`.

Note that those manifests and the images generated by them have no clear owners [DPTP-2589](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DPTP-2589) and the new versions of GoLang images are added by the OpenShift develpers by pull requests such as [this one](https://github.com/openshift/release/pull/35192/files). Moreover, only versions used by [the supported versions of OpenShift](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases) are kept and triggered on the cluster.
E.g., as this document was drafted on July 3 2023, OCP 4.9 has reached the end of life. 
The GoLang version 1.17 of OCP 4.10 can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4870701) of the corresponding Kubernetes](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4870701).
