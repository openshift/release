Release Controller Development Environment
==========================================

This service is really just the underlying infrastructure necessary to run an isolated
version of the release controller for testing the latest changes without the risk of taking
down the offical version that entire organization relies on.

Source code for the release controller is at https://github.com/openshift/release-controller
