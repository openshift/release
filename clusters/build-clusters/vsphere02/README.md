# common

This folder includes the resources shared by all clusters in CI-infrastructure.

We stopped applying to `api.ci` because it is going to be offline soon.

OCP-specific resources are temoporarily prefixed with `_` to avoid automatic application on OSD clusters. Those items are symlinked to OCP clusters' directories.
