  This priority class is equivalent to `openshift-user-critical`, except it is
  non-preemptive.  It is used by the pod-scaler as a hack to make pods with high
  resource usage schedulable in the build clusters.  Because the built-in
  classes (e.g. `openshift-user-critical`) are preemptive, they cause disruption
  when test pods are removed from the nodes to accomodate these high-prority
  pods (PDBs are configured for test pods, but they are not binding with regards
  to preemption).
