# We have a PDB that doesn't allow draining of nodes when they still have any test workloads. This
# means that cluster upgrades takes very long (days) if we stick to the default of 1 for maxUnavailable.
# Since the ClusterAutoscaler  will scale the cluster up if we run into capacity issues, this has no
# drawbacks (Ideally we would never do in-place upgrades and instead just create new nodes, but Openshift
# doesn't support that).
#
# Be careful to not add any further config options here, we don't want to manage the rest of the MachineConfigPools
# settings.
