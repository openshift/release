        summary: The deprovisioning of a cluster takes too long.
        description: Long deprovisioning of a cluster usually caused by some resources on the cloud that cannot be deleted by the OpenShift installer.
          It still occupies the quota of the cloud account. The owners of the cloud accounts should be informed to handle the case manually.
