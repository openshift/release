# Since we're importing an image from a private registry, then attempting to reference it via pullthrough on a
# derivative ImageStreamTag via the ImageStreamImage object, we're hitting a bug in the image registry:
#   https://github.com/openshift/image-registry/pull/271
# Until that bug is fixed and we've got it rolled out, we need to manually import this image by pulling it
# from the ICR registry, then pushing it to the clusters themselves.
