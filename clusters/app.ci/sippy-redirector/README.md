sippy-redirector
====

Deploys https://github.com/cgwalters/rhcos-redirector in app.ci.
Intended as a transient thing.

Sippy has moved to the dpcr cluster to be maintained by the TRT team. To keep DNS working so all existing links still function, DPTP suggested using a redirector service to point to the new deployment. (similar to rhcos-redirector)
