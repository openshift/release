          description: "ReleasePayload encapsulates the information for the creation of a ReleasePayload and aggregates the results of its respective verification tests. \n The release-controller is configured to monitor imagestreams, in a specific namespace, that are annotated with a ReleaseConfig.  The ReleaseConfig is a definition of how releases are calculated.  When a ReleasePayload is generated, it will be generated in the same namespace as the imagstream that produced it. If/when an update occurs, to one of these imagestreams, the release-controller will: 1. Create a point-in-time mirror of the updated imagestream 2. Create a new Release from the mirror - Any errors before this point will cause the release to marked `Failed` 3. Launches a set of release analysis jobs 4. Launches an aggregation job 5. Launches a set of release verification jobs - These can either be `Blocking Jobs` which will prevent release acceptance or `Informing Jobs` which will not prevent release acceptance. 6. For Stable releases, launches a set of jobs to test a subset of the supported upgrades defined inside the release image itself.  While these jobs do not have any real bearing on the acceptance or rejection of a ReleasePayload, they will be monitored and their respective results captured.  The hope would be to use these results to provide a convenient way to override a \"Rejected\" release caused by a blocking upgrade job. 7. Monitors for job completions - If all `Blocking Jobs` complete successfully, then the release is `Accepted`.  If any `Blocking Jobs` fail, the release will be marked `Rejected` 8. Publishes all results to the respective webpage \n Example: ART: 1. Publishes an update to the `ocp/4.9-art-latest` imagestream \n Release-controller: 1. Creates a mirror named: `ocp/4.9-art-latest-2021-09-27-105859` 2. Creates a ReleasePayload: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859` -Labels: release.openshift.io/imagestream=release release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859 3. Creates an OpenShift Release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859` 4. Update ReleasePayload conditions with results of release creation job If the release was created successfully, the release-controller: 5. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-analysis-<count> 6. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-aggregator 7. Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-<name> \n When ART promotes a GA release, they will assemble releases themselves, publish it to quay.io, and then update the \"stable\" release stream (i.e. ocp/release) with the corresponding payload.  In this scenario, the release-controller will perform all the same steps, mentioned above, but the mirror will be named after the \"official\" release (i.e. 4.9.7) and not not contain a timestamp.  Likewise, any verification tests will only contain the release name and the name of the verification test as defined in the ReleaseConfig.  The release-controller will also launch a small sample of jobs to test upgrades from the list of upgrade versions defined inside the release image itself: \n For example: $ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.11.22-x86_64 \n The list of supported upgrades is: 4.10.16, 4.10.17, 4.10.18, 4.10.20, 4.10.21, 4.10.22, 4.10.23, 4.10.24, 4.10.25, 4.10.26, 4.10.27, 4.10.28, 4.10.29, 4.10.30, 4.10.31, 4.10.32, 4.10.33, 4.10.34, 4.10.35, 4.10.36, 4.10.37, 4.10.38, 4.10.39, 4.10.40, 4.10.41, 4.10.42, 4.10.43, 4.10.44, 4.10.45, 4.10.46, 4.10.47, 4.11.0, 4.11.1, 4.11.2, 4.11.3, 4.11.4, 4.11.5, 4.11.6, 4.11.7, 4.11.8, 4.11.9, 4.11.10, 4.11.11, 4.11.12, 4.11.13, 4.11.14, 4.11.16, 4.11.17, 4.11.18, 4.11.19, 4.11.20, 4.11.21 \n From the list above, the release-controller will launch a subset of jobs named like: 4.11.22-upgrade-from-4.10.16-<platform> 4.11.22-upgrade-from-4.11.0-<platform> \n Where <platform> is defined in the Release Configuration definitions in the openshift/release repo: https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/e5c9122144c09c4095f0f87888b9685712dc7b1e/core-services/release-controller/_releases/release-ocp-4.y-stable.json#L20-L30 \n Mapping from a Release to ReleasePayload: A ReleasePayload will always be named after the Release that it corresponds to, with the addition of a random string suffix.  Both objects will reside in the same namespace. \n For a release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859` A corresponding ReleasePayload will exist: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859` \n Mapping from ReleasePayload to Release: A ReleasePayload is decorated with a couple labels that will point back to the Release that it corresponds to: - release.openshift.io/imagestream=release - release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859 \n Because the ReleasePayload and the Release will both reside in the same namespace, the release that created the ReleasePayload will be located here: \n <namespace>/<release.openshift.io/imagestream>:<release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name> \n Similarly, the ReleasePayload object itself also has the PayloadCoordinates (.spec.payloadCoordinates) that point back to the Release as well: \n spec: payloadCoordinates: imagestreamName: release imagestreamTagName: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859 namespace: ocp \n The release that created the ReleasePayload will be located here: \n <namespace>/<imagestreamName>:<imagestreamTagName> \n Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support."
