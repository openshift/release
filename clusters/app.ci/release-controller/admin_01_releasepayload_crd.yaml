        description: "ReleasePayload encapsulates the information for the creation
          of a ReleasePayload and aggregates the results of its respective verification
          tests. \n The release-controller is configured to monitor imagestreams,
          in a specific namespace, that are annotated with a ReleaseConfig.  The ReleaseConfig
          is a definition of how releases are calculated.  When a ReleasePayload is
          generated, it will be generated in the same namespace as the imagstream
          that produced it. If/when an update occurs, to one of these imagestreams,
          the release-controller will:   1) Create a point-in-time mirror of the updated
          imagestream   2) Create a new Release from the mirror        - Any errors
          before this point will cause the release to marked `Failed`   3) Launches
          a set of release analysis jobs   4) Launches an aggregation job   5) Launches
          a set of release verification jobs        - These can either be `Blocking
          Jobs` which will prevent release acceptance or `Informing Jobs` which will
          \         not prevent release acceptance.   6) Monitors for job completions
          \       - If all `Blocking Jobs` complete successfully, then the release
          is `Accepted`.  If any `Blocking Jobs` fail,          the release will be
          marked `Rejected`   7) Publishes all results to the respective webpage \n
          Example: ART:   1) Publishes an update to the `ocp/4.9-art-latest` imagestream
          \n Release-controller:   1) Creates a mirror named: `ocp/4.9-art-latest-2021-09-27-105859`
          \  2) Creates a ReleasePayload: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
          \      -Labels:         release.openshift.io/imagestream=release         release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859
          \  3) Creates an OpenShift Release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
          \  4) Update ReleasePayload conditions with results of release creation
          job   If the release was created successfully, the release-controller:   5)
          Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-analysis-<count>
          \  6) Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-aggregated-<name>-aggregator
          \  7) Launches: 4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859-<name> \n When ART promotes
          a GA release, they will assemble releases themselves, publish it to quay.io,
          and then update the \"stable\" release stream (i.e. ocp/release) with the
          corresponding payload.  In this scenario, the release-controller will perform
          all the same steps, mentioned above, but the mirror will be named after
          the \"official\" release (i.e. 4.9.7) and not not contain a timestamp.  Likewise,
          any verification tests will only contain the release name and the name of
          the verification test as defined in the ReleaseConfig. \n Mapping from a
          Release to ReleasePayload: A ReleasePayload will always be named after the
          Release that it corresponds to, with the addition of a random string suffix.
          \ Both objects will reside in the same namespace.   For a release: `ocp/release:4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
          \  A corresponding ReleasePayload will exist: `ocp/4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859`
          \n Mapping from ReleasePayload to Release: A ReleasePayload is decorated
          with a couple labels that will point back to the Release that it corresponds
          to:   - release.openshift.io/imagestream=release   - release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name=4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859
          Because the ReleasePayload and the Release will both reside in the same
          namespace, the release that created the ReleasePayload will be located here:
          \  <namespace>/<release.openshift.io/imagestream>:<release.openshift.io/imagestreamtag-name>
          Similarly, the ReleasePayload object itself also has the PayloadCoordinates
          (.spec.payloadCoordinates) that point back to the Release as well:   spec:
          \    payloadCoordinates:       imagestreamName: release       imagestreamTagName:
          4.9.0-0.nightly-2021-09-27-105859       namespace: ocp The release that
          created the ReleasePayload will be located here:   <namespace>/<imagestreamName>:<imagestreamTagName>
          \n Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change
          at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications
          needing long term support."
