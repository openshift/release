# Boskos cleaner is needed to allow resources created out of dynamic resource lifecycle to
# be deleted.
# It is responsible for checking if resources that were created based on
# dynamic resource lifecycles have child resources defined in their userdata and if yes,
# mark those as to be deleted as well.
# Afterwards the resources are put into tombstone state which makes boskos delete them
# the next time it syncs its config.
