> I want the command to take a config name string and a release string, then do the following,
  1. git pull.
  2. create a new branch with the config name string as branch name.
  3. find the file in ci-operator/config/openshift/openshift-tests-private that contain the config name string, the file name should contain the release string and not contain 'upgrade'
  4. locate the code block that starts with the line containing the config name string
  5. add a new line of '    - ref: cucushift-hypershift-extended-debug' under the line containing '-chain'
  6. commit and push the change with the config name string as the message
  7. submit a pull request to https://github.com/openshift/release.git
  8. wait for a comment from openshift-ci-robot that starts with '[REHEARSALNOTIFIER]'
  9. look for a table in the command and obtain the string in the 'Test name' row
  10. add a comment of '/pj-rehearse' plus the string obtained from last step
