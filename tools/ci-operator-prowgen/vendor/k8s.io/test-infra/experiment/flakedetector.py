"""Counts the number of flakes in PRs using data from prow.

A flake is counted if a job passes and fails for the same pull commit. This
isn't a perfect signal, since something might have happened on master that
makes it flake, but I think it's good enough. There will also be false
negatives when flakes don't show up because the PR author changed the PR.
Still, this is a good signal.

Only serial jobs are considered for the flake calculation, batch jobs are
ignored.
