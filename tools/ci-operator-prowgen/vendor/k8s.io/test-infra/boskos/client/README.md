# Boskos Client Library

Boskos client is a go client library interfaces [boskos server](../README.md).

Users of boskos need to use boskos client to communicate with the deployed boskos service.

# Initialize

A boskos client instance is initialized with the URL of target boskos server accompanied with owner of the client.

The client object looks like:

```
type Client struct {
	url       string
	resources []string
	owner     string
}
```

To create a boskos client, use NewClient func, specify boskos server url, and owner of the client:
```
func NewClient(url string, owner string) *Client
```
