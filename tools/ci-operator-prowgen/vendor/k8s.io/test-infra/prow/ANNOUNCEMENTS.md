# Announcements

New features added to each components:
 - *July 13, 2018* `blunderbluss` plugin will now support `required_reviewers` in
   OWNERS file to specify a person or github team to be cc'd on every PR that
   touches the corresponding part of the code.
 - *June 25, 2018* `updateconfig` plugin will now support update/remove keys
   from a glob match.
 - *June 05, 2018* `blunderbuss` plugin may now suggest approvers in addition
   to reviewers. Use `exclude_approvers: true` to revert to previous behavior.
 - *April 10, 2018* `cla` plugin now supports `/check-cla` command
   to force rechecking of the CLA status.
 - *February 1, 2018* `updateconfig` will now update any configmap on merge
 - *November 14, 2017* `jenkins-operator:0.58` exposes prometheus metrics.
 - *November 8, 2017* `horologium:0.14` prow periodic job now support cron
   triggers. See https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/robfig/cron.v2 for doc to the
   cron library we are using.

Breaking changes to external APIs (labels, GitHub interactions, configuration
or deployment) will be documented in this section. Prow is in a pre-release
state and no claims of backwards compatibility are made for any external API.
Note: versions specified in these announcements may not include bug fixes made
in more recent versions so it is recommended that the most recent versions are
used when updating deployments.

 - *July 9, 2018* `milestone` format has changed from
    ```yaml
    milestone:
     maintainers_id: <some_team_id>
     maintainers_team: <some_team_name>
    ```
    to `repo_milestone`
    ```yaml
    repo_milestone:
     <some_repo_name>:
       maintainers_id: <some_team_id>
       maintainers_team: <some_team_name>
    ```
 - *July 2, 2018* the `trigger` plugin will now trust PRs from repo
   collaborators. Use `only_org_members: true` in the trigger config to
   temporarily disable this behavior.
 - *June 14, 2018* the `updateconfig` plugin will only add data to your `ConfigMaps`
   using the basename of the updated file, instead of using that and also duplicating
   the data using the name of the `ConfigMap` as a key
 - *June 1, 2018* all unquoted `boolean` fields in config.yaml that were unmarshall
   into type `string` now need to be quoted to avoid unmarshalling error.
 - *May 9, 2018* `deck` logs for jobs run as `Pods` will now return logs for the
   `"test"` container only.
 - *April 2, 2018* `updateconfig` format has been changed from
   ```yaml
   path/to/some/other/thing: configName
   ```
   to
   ```yaml
   path/to/some/other/thing:
     Name: configName
     # If unspecified, Namespace default to the value of ProwJobNamespace.
     Namespace: myNamespace
   ```
 - *March 15, 2018* `jenkins_operator` is removed from the config in favor of
   `jenkins_operators`.
 - *March 1, 2018* `MilestoneStatus` has been removed from the plugins Configuration
   in favor of the `Milestone` which is shared between two plugins: 1) `milestonestatus`
   and 2) `milestone`.  The milestonestatus plugin now uses the `Milestone` object to
   get the maintainers team ID
 - *February 27, 2018* `jenkins-operator` does not use `$BUILD_ID` as a fallback
   to `$PROW_JOB_ID` anymore.
 - *February 15, 2018* `jenkins-operator` can now accept the `--tot-url` flag
   and will use the connection to `tot` to vend build identifiers as `plank`
   does, giving control over where in GCS artifacts land to Prow and away from
   Jenkins. Furthermore, the `$BUILD_ID` variable in Jenkins jobs will now
   correctly point to the build identifier vended by `tot` and a new variable,
   `$PROW_JOB_ID`, points to the identifier used to link ProwJobs to Jenkins builds.
   `$PROW_JOB_ID` fallbacks to `$BUILD_ID` for backwards-compatibility, ie. to
   not break in-flight jobs during the time of the jenkins-operator update.
 - *February 1, 2018* The `config_updater` section in `plugins.yaml`
 now uses a `maps` object instead of `config_file`, `plugin_file` strings.
 Please switch over before July.
 - *November 30, 2017* If you use tide, you'll need to switch your query format
 and bump all prow component versions to reflect the changes in #5754.
 - *November 14, 2017* `horologium:0.17` fixes cron job not being scheduled.
 - *November 10, 2017* If you want to use cron feature in prow, you need to bump to:
 `hook:0.181`, `sinker:0.23`, `deck:0.62`, `splice:0.32`, `horologium:0.15`
 `plank:0.60`, `jenkins-operator:0.57` and `tide:0.12` to avoid error spamming from
 the config parser.
 - *November 7, 2017* `plank:0.56` fixes bug introduced in `plank:0.53` that
   affects controllers using an empty kubernetes selector.
 - *November 7, 2017* `jenkins-operator:0.51` provides jobs with the `$BUILD_ID`
   variable as well as the `$buildId` variable. The latter is deprecated and will
   be removed in a future version.
 - *November 6, 2017* `plank:0.55` provides `Pods` with the `$BUILD_ID` variable
   as well as the `$BUILD_NUMBER` variable. The latter is deprecated and will be
   removed in a future version.
 - *November 3, 2017* Added `EmptyDir` volume type. To update to `hook:0.176+`
   or `horologium:0.11+` the following components must have the associated
   minimum versions: `deck:0.58+`, `plank:0.54+`, `jenkins-operator:0.50+`.
 - *November 2, 2017* `plank:0.53` changes the `type` label key to `prow.k8s.io/type`
   and the `job` annotation key to `prow.k8s.io/job` added in pods.
 - *October 14, 2017* `deck:0:53+` needs to be updated in conjunction with
   `jenkins-operator:0:48+` since Jenkins logs are now exposed from the
   operator and `deck` needs to use the `external_agent_logs` option in order
   to redirect requests to the location `jenkins-operator` exposes logs.
 - *October 13, 2017* `hook:0.174`, `plank:0.50`, and `jenkins-operator:0.47`
   drop the deprecated `github-bot-name` flag.
 - *October 2, 2017* `hook:0.171`: The label plugin was split into three
   plugins (label, sigmention, milestonestatus). Breaking changes:
   - The configuration key for the milestone maintainer team's ID has been
   changed. Previously the team ID was stored in the plugins config at key
   `label`>>`milestone_maintainers_id`. Now that the milestone status labels are
   handled in the `milestonestatus` plugin instead of the `label` plugin, the
   team ID is stored at key `milestonestatus`>>`maintainers_id`.
   - The sigmention and milestonestatus plugins must be enabled on any repos
   that require them since their functionality is no longer included in the
   label plugin.
 - *September 3, 2017* `sinker:0.17` now deletes pods labeled by `plank:0.42` in
   order to avoid cleaning up unrelated pods that happen to be found in the
   same namespace prow runs pods. If you run other pods in the same namespace,
   you will have to manually delete or label the prow-owned pods, otherwise you
   can bulk-label all of them with the following command and let sinker collect
   them normally:
   ```
   kubectl label pods --all -n pod_namespace created-by-prow=true
   ```
 - *September 1, 2017* `deck:0.44` and `jenkins-operator:0.41` controllers
   no longer provide a default value for the `--jenkins-token-file` flag.
   Cluster administrators should provide `--jenkins-token-file=/etc/jenkins/jenkins`
   explicitly when upgrading to a new version of these components if they were
   previously relying on the default. For more context, please see
   [this pull request.](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/4210)
 - *August 29, 2017* Configuration specific to plugins is now held in the
   `plugins` `ConfigMap` and serialized in this repo in the `plugins.yaml` file.
   Cluster administrators upgrading to `hook:0.148` or newer should move
   plugin configuration from the main `ConfigMap`. For more context, please see
   [this pull request.](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/4213)
