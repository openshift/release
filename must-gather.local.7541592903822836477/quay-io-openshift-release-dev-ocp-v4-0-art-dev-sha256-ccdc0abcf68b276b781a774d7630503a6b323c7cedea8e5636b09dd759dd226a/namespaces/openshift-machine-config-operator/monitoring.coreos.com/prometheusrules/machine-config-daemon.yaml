          workload out of memory events impacting the proper functioning of the node.
          The default reservation is expected to be sufficient for most configurations
          and should be increased (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-managing.html)

        description: Given three control plane nodes, the overall memory utilization
          may only be about 2/3 of all available capacity. This is because if a single
          control plane node fails, the kube-apiserver and etcd may be slow to respond.
          To fix this, increase memory of the control plane nodes.
        summary: Memory utilization across all control plane nodes is high, and could
          impact responsiveness and stability.

          to cluster instability and slow responses from kube-apiserver or failing
          requests specially on etcd. Moreover, OOM kill is expected which negatively
          influences the pod scheduling. If this happens on container level, the descheduler
          will not be able to detect it, as it works on the pod level. To fix this,
          increase memory of the affected node of control plane nodes.
