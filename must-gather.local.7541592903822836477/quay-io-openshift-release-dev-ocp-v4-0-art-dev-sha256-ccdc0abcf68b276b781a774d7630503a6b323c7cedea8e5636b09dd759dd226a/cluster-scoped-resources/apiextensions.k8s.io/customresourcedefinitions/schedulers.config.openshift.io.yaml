              defaultNodeSelector:
                description: 'defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default
                  node selector to restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This
                  is applied to the pods created in all namespaces and creates an
                  intersection with any existing nodeSelectors already set on a pod,
                  additionally constraining that pod''s selector. For example, defaultNodeSelector:
                  "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector field in pod
                  spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created in all
                  namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won''t
                  be impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section
                  to the namespace. For example, if a new namespace is created with
                  node-selector=''type=user-node,region=east'', the annotation openshift.io/node-selector:
                  type=user-node,region=east gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector
                  annotation is set on the project the value is used in preference
                  to the value we are setting for defaultNodeSelector field. For instance,
                  openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means that
                  the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                  would not be applied.'

                  will be made schedulable, so that workload pods can run on them.
                  The default value for this field is false, meaning none of the master
                  nodes are schedulable. Important Note: Once the workload pods start
                  running on the master nodes, extreme care must be taken to ensure
                  that cluster-critical control plane components are not impacted.
