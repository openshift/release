                      option is set to "false", the Isolated CPU set will be static,
                      meaning workloads have to explicitly assign each thread to a
                      specific cpu in order to work across multiple CPUs. Setting
                      this to "true" allows workloads to be balanced across CPUs.
                      Setting this to "false" offers the most predictable performance
                      for guaranteed workloads, but it offloads the complexity of

                      It is important to notice the CPU manager can choose any CPU
                      to run the workload except the reserved CPUs. In order to guarantee

                  values will be set on the node by the performance-addon-operator.
                  It is important to notice that setting hugepages default size to
                  1G will remove all 2M related folders from the node and it will
                  be impossible to configure 2M hugepages under the node.
